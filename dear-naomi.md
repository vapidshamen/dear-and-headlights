hi naomi, now that you aren't my therapist I can literally just tell you what I have on my mind and you don't have to say/respond anything... lol. so anyway, on monday, when you said to me, "well then what do you need me for?" -- I felt something coming from you that I hadn't felt in a very long time. the feeling you emitted felt very strongly like this one time back in 2011 when I told patricia (like I told you, I feel as very similar to her) that I didn't want to learn german and it just wasn't going to work out. she emitted the same feeling that you did, which was a feeling of a sort of collapsed plan. to give some context, at the time I think she wanted to enter into a stable relationship with me. I really wanted to as well, because in my mind I'd built up all of these great programming ideas that we could work on and create together -- because I've got tremendous charisma and the ability to make things happen, plus a sense for user interface and things -- the main thing I was lacking on for large technical projects was someone that's analytical and stastistical like she was. in my mind, she was the perfect person that I could find -- and here, seemingly she wants to make a semi-stable relationship with me. so it would seem like the perfect thing to do (if I only looked at the situation analytically) -- the problem is though that my emotions were screaming out to me that I simply cannot do it. nothing about it felt right, and I just couldn't make it work in my emotional mind.
	a major factor is that as I was beginning to listen and learn a bit of german, is that I was going the wrong direction: I started to feel the structure of the language, and (though I had a somewhat similar feeling with spanish), it really felt like if I were to learn german my ability to construct well-formed rhetoric (the ability to sway people with words) would totally skyrocket. also, I could feel this very strong war-like behaviour that came with it as well -- as in just apply enough force to the issue, and progress can be made. the language made me feel forceful and pursuasive in a way that I didn't like. additionally, I was really quite happy with "the spanish way" which wasn't building perfect machines that performed at their optimum (the way I was before I came to spain), but instead personifying the idea that I could strap a few chapuzas together and get something working. I was learning to be messy and sloppy, and that it's OK to not have things in such a perfect and optimal way (which was my main contention with the spanish programmers that we hired -- cause they'd just make a mess of the code everywhere, and not having the ability to reason abstractly used a lot of brute force, leaving a lot of unnecessary clutter in the code everywhere). I was trying to learn how to be OK with clutter and lots of non-perfect/optimal solutions (the thing that erik was always saying we needed to have, even though they often times performed worse). I was trading performance/speed for correctness/rightness -- and learning german felt to me like I was going in the exactly opposite direction that I wanted to go.
	also during that time, I didn't really have any emotions too much before I went to spain. I was pretty robotic, and learning the spanish way was teaching me to accept my emotional side too. I didn't really know what to do with my emotions, and they caused me to do things like like girls, but at the same time, my emotions are just really not wanting to let me go into this pre-programmed lifestyle that it felt like patricia had prepared for me. it felt like she had prepared a fully-formed box or something that would organise and make me behave and respond in a well-defined way. just the idea of continuing on with her in the relationship felt terrible. all of my life, when faced with a decision, I project myself forward in time to feel how it feels, and then based on how that feels (supposing the conditions), I do the thing if I like how it feels. for example, with tuenti, when I projected myself forward in time, I could viscerally feel having created the website and how awesome it was going to be. I arrived to spain knowing already that would be my future. well, in the same way, I felt the visceral future of what it would be like to be stuck in patricia's future felt so terrible to me, I just had to tell her no. I didn't have (then) the capacity to express m/ emotions as well as I do now (and likely this is the best explanation she's ever been given, ever, either).
the only thing I could probably really tell her were incoherent ideas and the answer "no" or "I just can't". when I first told her, we were at the co-working space and I remember the feeling of having me rip her plan to shreds devistated her so much, a tremendous storm came out of nowhere and it started raining really really hard. I called her "tormenta" ever since. I really did feel bad for causing her so much anguish and grief and stuff, but I just couldn't go that way. I don't know how much she blamed herself or anything -- but having 13y of hindsight on it (and been harshly rained on by other saturnian types), I've learned a lot about how venusian/saturnian people work. they get this whole structure built up in their head about how things should go, and then when it doesn't go as planned, it's like the picture of father kronos, the broken corinthian column, and the distraught maiden -- a very sad experience, because all expectations of everything just crumble.
I don't know exactly the why the feeling that I felt from you was so similar to patricia's -- so I'm going to make a whole lot of assumptions (cause even if you were there and I could ask you, I hardly doubt you'd have any direct answers to my questions, and perhaps may even feel embarrassment from my assumptions too). anyway, judging by the way you reacted to me telling you a few months ago that I'd be going to utah, I have to assume that you (or the archetype of venus in general) had built up a whole lot of ideas and plans around (perhaps, not sure which ones) some of my genetics ideas, perhaps it was the black-mirror-idea, or perhaps it was some other idea -- but the trigger seemed to be the realisation that I would no longer be actively/willfully pursuing those ideas anymore. it seems that, if I'm going to be going in a direction of "no longer outputting" (only-attraction), then "why do I need you?" I just sit around (on my hands) and wait for the world to come to me, making no effort to go after the things that I thought I wanted. I'm going to assume that it must have something to do with that -- or maybe that I simply cannot go in the direction of having any relationships anymore (or maybe both).
	I'd like to point out the similarity to this situation and the situation with patricia as well: I really thought (analytically), that patricia was the person that I must have been looking for. and so, because she met all of the criteria of what I thought I wanted (just like the genetics and the black-mirror-idea and all that stuff was the stuff I thought I wanted to create), I (unfortunately or fortunately -- not really sure) decided to really begin going after this opportunity that was in front of me (patricia). I consulted all the grandmasters of picking up chicks (mccord, rupert, etc) the best ways to try and get her -- and used a lot of the different techniques that I'd learned in the past -- but I gatta say, they didn't work too well for me, so I just switched it up for being myself. that had it's good points and bad points because (for example) I'm a pretty proud person of the things that I create, and I wanted to just say what I wanted, but the combination of those gave me the impression (actually she told me) that I was really arrogant, and using my creation (tuenti) to pick up chicks and get sex and stuff -- nothing could have been farther from the truth there, but trying to be some other less arrogant and more palletable version of myself wasn't working. my confidence and charisma eventually worked it out such that we were having regular coffees and talking pretty often. I wanted to just tell her directly what I wanted -- but it felt to me like she didn't want me to -- like she wanted to play games and stuff (well, I'm bad at social cues, so that failed miserably) -- so I was never actually direct and honest with her. I think she had a very different picture of who I was in her mind than I was -- probably cause she was assuming that I was "like all guys are" (I always prove venusian/saturnian types' beliefs/expectations about me. I can't behave/appear as anything other than what they believe about me or the general archetype that I represent to them (geek/nerd/man/"crazy coder guy"/etc)). I think she eventually saw my complete incompetence in being able to make the perfect date or whatever happen (cause I was working against her own beliefs about the archetypes that she wanted me to be, but some other version of them) that she finally did the work for me (it had to be that way, or nothing would have ever happened), and I was quite thankful, because I really didn't know at all how to act around her. I was always inferior to her and subject to her ridicule, almost as if it was necessary for her to bring me and my high opinion of myself down to her level. anyway, as it progressed, sure it seemed like I was making physical progress with her, but I never left her feeling better, but I always had this sadness that something didn't work out the way it was supposed to go (later on, I realized that to probably be how she felt), and I never felt like I was more smarter or capable of doing the programming things that I wanted. I was quickly realising that she isn't what I'm looking for. I didn't want someone structured and ordered, but instead someone that's sloppy and messy, and not trying to make things go a certain way -- someone I could just say what I wanted to do, and we'd find a way to make them happen (sorta like how zaryn was at the beginning).
	the same thing is happening in the present moment too. I saw this thing that I totally thought I wanted (black-mirror-idea and genetics stuff -- just like patricia), but I'm totally incapable of making it happen. I feel like if I were to try and get into trying to build it in a symbolic/logical way, it would quitkly be shown how many holes there are in my ideas and how little I actually know on the subject (just like patricia did for me about probabilities and data analysis) -- and that would probably cause a lot of a loss in confidence and stuff. most of my knowledge is *conceptual*, which means that it's pretty difficult to actually turn into real mathematical theories and formulas -- but I know how it *should* all fit together in my mind, so I just have to take it slow and do the wikipedia thing where I look it up, implement it in code, and then just sorta trial-and-error it all the way to something that works (the chapuza method), because all along the way, I have to learn and figure out what the heck I'm doing. so, just like how patricia was totally the thing I thought I wanted, over time, the realisation that I'm not really ready (I don't have the things I want to build with her well thought out and planned in a way that would work for her mind), and neither do I really want to be ready in that sort of way either (I really can't possibly be able to keep all of that stuff in my head and follow some kind of plan) -- the whole thing just starts to feel worse and worse the closer I get to it. I'm not saying that it'll never happen, but trying to figure it out and follow some kind of plan, *will not work for me*. then, imagine that somehow the venusian girls -- same thing, notice my incapacity to be able to make my perceived dream come to pass, and decide to do the work for me -- there's still the entire problem of *communication*: none of us can have any open communication and all these secrets have to be kept to uphold a bunch of illusions -- which, just like with patricia, causes a whole lot of problems. (somehow) I gave her some sort of illusion that I was a totally different person than I was -- and that caused her to build up these impossible to realise expectations on my part. her expectations of me were so strong that I couldn't just tell her that I'm not the big superstar that she thinks I am. so, imagine then that somehow we solve the communication issue, and no longer is nosebook and all of the other taboo subjects off-limits, there's still the entire problem that the idea doesn't even feel good to me anymore. it's not what I want to make anymore. I dunno what it is that I do want to make, but it's probably not that. finally, the idea of having any sort of relationship with anyone feels so terrible to me now. I went the drugs path now -- adderall is really helping me to turn into a black-hole much much more rapidly and much more smoothely than any sort of physical or sexual relationship would do. I really like how I'm going now, because I'm acquiring/assimilating so many other people's concepts *at a distance* -- which means that big things aren't breaking, and there's no massive chaos or anything like that. I just absorb, and things go better and better all the time.
whatever the case, all of those ideas (genetics, sex/relationships, black-mirror-idea, etc) have completely gone from me now. I don't want anything to do with them, and I refuse to have anyone else try and put them into my experience either. if I had've done any of those ideas, I would have been 2nd-ray because I would have been figuring out the "best" manifestation in my mind, and then (willfully) creating that. instead, I'm going in the opposite direction of that, where I'm just absorbing/observing (non-judgementally) until whatever it is comes. I really don't mind that anyone else can do those ideas -- and in fact, I would greatly prefer it. I know I can't compete with all the other guys out there -- cause they're all way smarter and have a much much better grasp of tech than I do. they'll create way way way better stuff than anything I could ever build, and that's fine for me. I don't need to prove myself at all in any way -- cause where I excel at, isn't symbolic and analytical reasoning -- but in feeling the way I want to feel, and being receptive to new things and ideas. at the rate I'm going (which is fast enough), I find it silly to even think about trying to build something that I'm in the process of becoming.
*I am* the thing I wanted to create. for example, in the genetics concept, the idea is that there are all of these 1st-ray kens running around, being a reflection of the barbies that (essentially) own them. however, in order to be 1st-ray, I can't be building stuff -- that's 2nd-ray. I can't be both at the same time. I'm either attracting or I'm symbolically receiving -- not both. I mean, I could do both, but that would be doing dbt not msc -- and I'm not doing the willful side of dbt anymore (or at least not trying to).
