### 2024-11-01 20:11 - on gender and sexual attraction

I've never had to formulate these thoughts into words and understandable concepts before. for context, I should give a brief sexual history: I grew up in a church where nearly everything pleasurable was prohibited -- and the way that my mother is/was (was more than is), anything that made a person feel good which didn't come from God, was a work of the devil and would be against God's desire for his children. very very early on (maybe 7yo), I liked a girl, but my brother also liked her too, and I'm such a non-competitive person, I'm just like, "yeah dude, she's all yours" and backed away from the thing. later on (maybe 11yo) I also liked a girl and I didn't really know what to do about it. it was obvious that I liked her and mom confronted me on it, and basically told me, "OK, but you're way too young and that's not acceptable" -- so I kinda grew up just figuring that anything love related would be something that I would experience later on in my life once I was an adult (in that church there was to be no childhood love interests).
then, like I told you, in middle school I was very strong and smart but I thought that I could solve problems with physical effort. (now that I think about it I didn't realise it was the same guy) the guy that I knocked the wind out of in elementary school (4th grade I think) and then took him to the nurse's office, I later on pushed off the top of the stairs cause he was making fun of me. they wanted to suspend me, and mom knew that I was much smarter than that (I'd just completed geometry in summer school previously), and combined with the fact that they wanted to put me into pre-algebra (something I already knew cause I could perform mathematical calculations (visually) in my mind), caused her to help me to take the california proficiency exam (equiv of high-school diploma) and go to cal state LA instead of going to 7th grade. at uni, I took electronics classes, and in there there were basically only old dudes (40yo+), so I was never around girls in a secular setting (only at gymnastics classes, and sometimes at home-school meetups). other than that, there were tons of girls at church, but because of my church upbringing (they were all off-limits until I'm an adult, cause pre-marital sex was a huge nono) and my friend chris, I pretty much passed on girls entirely. I had the brain haemorrhage when I was 16, and relearning to walk and be a functional human being took top priority, so I never even considered having a girlfriend. I also stopped going to uni, and instead started a technical college when I was 17. there weren't really girls there at all (I only remember 2 and I wasn't terribly attracted to either). so, again, I hung out with 40yo+ dudes and learned programming. I got really good at that and started working on a social network in LA, which eventually lead one of the guys to take me to spain to make a social network there.
in spain, I was totally out of my element. it's totally full of macho dudes that are all into grabbing these girls and buying them drinks and stuff -- a form of behaviour that I didn't want to do (I'm a very passive person, only really liking the girls that come up to me and engaging to me). I was very very smart and I saw myself as essentially "the catch of the millenium" -- a person that I figured, if the girl could just see me for who I am and all of the skills and capacities that I have, they'd *should* be scrambling to try and get me -- and I felt very very uncomfortable trying to go after a girl -- when, obviously I'm the one she should be going after. the spanish dudes saw me as timid or something, because after watching me fail at "closing the deal" with countless women one party weekend in marbella (you have to understand here that the way that we were "marketing" our social network is to get lots and lots of really hot girls on the website and have them to get the guys to come in and try to get them) -- so here I am, a total loser incapable with girls who's out with them in the discos, and I should be this alpha dude that behaves (in their perception) in accordance with my ego (ie, anyone that has that high of an opinion of theirself is litterally grabbing women and telling them to come home with them (and they'd do it too)) -- but I just couldn't do it. I kept waiting for this mythical girl that would come and see m5 for who I am, sweep me off my feet and take me home. in the spanish culture that's not really what happens though, so they would spend lots of time trying to teach me how to be the aggressor/hunter, going after the meat that I wanted to have.
a long story short, I spent many a drunk night trying to figure out how to become the hunter not the prey, but I really have this problem, which is that no matter what I did, I couldn't hide my intentions. if I tried to go after them, they knew I was going after them, and if I didn't go after them, they liked me, but didn't go after me. it was a complete stalemate, and the only way that I could improve on the situation would be to learn how to disguise my intentions -- but I just couldn't ever figure out how to do it (I'm too stright-forward and they wanted someone that wouldn't say or notice the obvious (as in, "oh surprise, I didn't know I'd end up with this guy cause he's totally swept me off my feet with his amazing body/words and the way he convinced/lured me into his sexual trap (at which point, like a deer in headlights they'd accept their sexual fate of having been trapped/hunted by him))). I just could never figure it out.
my first experiences were forced on me (they said, "we're not leaving until you go in") with prostitutes. on hindsight, I'm actually glad it turned out that way because if there was any hope for a relationship, I would have latched on to her immediately. I remember on the drive home thinking just how amazing she was and all these great things (even though I didn't really enjoy the actual physical act, feeling only minor rubbing and irritation, and no real pleasure that I can remember). mostly I wanted to talk and find a girl that could share a completely clear communication relationship with me (as if we were "one flesh" as taught by paul, and desired by my mother of my father). I never found such a woman -- ever. there have been zero women that wanted to have zero secrets, shared everything, and a completely in-sync relationship with me (where we operated as if we were one mind and body).
I met a girl in the canary islands, but she didn't want to be that close to me (also, I think she was lesbian, and I was kind of an embarassment to her because she *should* be hooking up with girls, not with a guy -- so she never wanted to go to any public place, and tried to stay away from places where we'd be seen together). that obviousn't wasn't going to work, so I had to let her go. a met another in berlin, but she wanted to organise my life for me, and unfortunately by that time I'd given up on the idea of "one flesh" too, cause even though she wanted me to start doing all of the things to begin living the rest of her life with me (like learning german and stuff), at the same time she wanted to maintain a strictly professsional relationship with me -- and neither was she interested in merging her mind with mine, so that we could operate well together. she was very calculated, and I'm very emotional/conceptual. unfortunately I knew it could never work so I let her go too. later that evening, a receptionist I met in barcelona invited me to her house, so I left the berlin thing behind and went off to barcelona to be with a girl that finally wanted to be with me (ie, I didn't have to ask to be with her, and she instead wanted to be with me). while we lived in separate locations, it was really great and stuff, but as soon as I started to merge with her consciousness so that we could be "one flesh", things started to fall apart. I eventually had to let her go too. it's unfortunate though because during sex, I could feel her body as if it were my own, and I started to experience her thoughts as if they were my own, which means that her thoughts would have to update and improve in the same ways that I'd updated and improved on my own thoughts -- but in reality, I was starting to take over her autonomy wanting her to do things as if she were me. I was violating her individuality.
I eventually realized that it's just not possible for me to actually merge with another person in that way (as if I had 2 or more bodies all in which I/we, all thinking in harmony, control the way that I control my body (intuitively/conceptually)). so, since I realisation that I can't assimilate other people into my own consciousness (as if we were "one flesh"), I had to "radically accept the reality" that the only person that I can affect is myself. therefore, since it's just not possible to get what I wanted, I'd have to find a way to become fully accepting and enjoying of living in my own body/reality, not needing something/someone else outside of me to behave/be/do/have what I want them to have.

now, when it comes to gender, it's common to think that females are the receptive half of the population,-- but not all of them are receptive energetically. I'm far more feminine (in the energetically receptive sense) than the majority of them -- however, I fully identify and and fully enjoying being in a masculine body. I really like the way I am, and I wouldn't trade places with anyone else for any other reason (not even unlimited money or any other perks). there's nothing that would ever want me to be anyone or anything other than myself. I really have an insanely inflated opinion of myself. I sorta look down even on so many of the other posers out there that are pretending to like theirselves, but in reality, they're out there looking for things outside of theirself to fill in for what they're missing (like I used to be/do). I would *never* want to go back to that way of thinking. so, as a highly receptive person, I would identify myself as neither male or female, but as *receptive*.
when it comes to sexuality (as mentioned above), it's just not possible for me to try and force someone else to have such a high opinion of theirself, or to actually like theirselves that much (ie, be as attractive as I am) -- so, it seems obvious now (on hindsight) that I have to be receptive and just wait for others to merge with me, not the other way around. I'm not going to try and force anything on anyone. I'll be around a while, and I'll wait. it's worth the wait (from my perspective). therfore, to put a label on it, I'd be considered "asexual" or basically not at all attracted to what's out there now.
