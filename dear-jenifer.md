### 2024-12-08 23:25 - evolution of desire

when we were talking tonight about stuff, I omitted a pretty significant detail (and potentially gave the wrong impression as well), mostly because I didn't really know how to summarise it in any consise or meaningful way. looking back on it just now I might have given the impression that I was a bit upset with these various young girls taking interest in me, and also that I didn't know what to do about it. neither of those impressions are true.
like I mentioned, late 2012 the raquel thing was totally done. I got beat up by a guy wanting 5eur that I had for another crack rock and had to move away from alcobendas (a suburb of madrid where I was living -- the house raquel and I got). having that whole world crash down to bits, I had to rethink things consierably. you see, all of my life, the stuff that I *believe* is possible, is. I have *always* been able to do the things that I think are possible, and to a large extent, the futures that I believed were going to happen, also did. I came to spain with full belief that tuenti was going to be a massive success, and that I was going to begin to reshape the world to be the one that I lived in, starting with that social network. however, it obviously didn't work out, and my opinion of it is that the network posed a pretty serious threat to various competitors, and their desire for such a network to not exist was pushed against in the "saturnian-system" (the visual/symbolic system whereby time can be manipulated to produce the reality that they desire) -- and so after trying so hard to push out my ideas out on to the world, I finally had to give up on that whole thing and just let it go. also, I should mention that when I met raquel, she was just a receptionist at a hotel, but I felt an extreme amount of affinity with her, which is why I was so drawn to talk to her. after she invited me to barcelona and we got together, again, I had full belief that I'd met essentially the woman of my dreams. I had realised that such a structured and analytical woman like patricia wasn't what I was really looking for -- and again, my optimism lead me to believe (and I had lots of "visions" and premonitions of it) that we were going to have this amazing relationship, and that she was going to be able to really help me bring my ideas out to reality.
	however, I think this too was thwarted becuase, I'm pretty sure that I would have figured out star-watching on the attic patio that we had, yet the landlord (also named raquel) decided to put in a big gazebo right before we moved in. there were also a number of other things that derailed our relationship as well, but they're too numerous to mention. either way, looking back on it, I'm pretty sure that relationship also fell apart cause of the influence of the saturnian-system too.
with her gone, my whole system of "creating reality" (through my belief) just simply isn't working. I couldn't seem to get any of the stuff to work out the way that I believed they were going to work out (though it did work previously)	-- so distraught by thinking that all is lost, I finally started learning about how "law of attraction" works. I recognised pretty quickly that visualisation and belief are really inferior techniques -- and that emotion and my perception of reality really is the precursor to every manifestation. unsure of what it is that I actually did want (and neither did I want to try to visualise/believe it (cause this is output)), I turned to attraction instead, which essentially states that my reality will reflect how I feel. so, I gave up all of my attempts to try and figure out what it is that I wanted beforehand (like I did with with patricia where I calculated prior to going to berlin that a girl exactly like her would be what I was looking for -- then getting to berlin, there she was -- but my calculations were off a bit, because it turned out perhaps I was wrong). so, instead of outputting what I want, I was just going to feel good about things, and avoid all of the drama chicks (cause they felt bad to me) and just *allow* the one that felt like me to show up. I essentially turned asexual, because as I encountered various girls passing through my life, sure many were physically attractive, but I didn't like how they *felt* (ie, they were usually obsessing over things and experiencing emotions (drama) that I didn't like how it felt). I stayed asexual for quite a while, essentially finding nobody that felt good to me.
as I worked with marcos on afinaty (the social network based on affinity), our disagreements provided me with a whole lot of opportunity to learn to feel good no matter the circumstances (I'd worked on another social network previously called essembly that also had idological proximity, and from my experience there, I felt like I had a much better grasp on what he should create, yet he didn't want to do things *my way*, and that made me angry). I finally gave up and just started to do things his way, deciding that I preferred to feel good, rather than be right or to have things go my way. I really started to get good at that, and I was really starting to feel really good pretty consistently, when his daughter (andrea) started to become a major factor. apparently me feeling pretty good and having the ability to feel good in siutations where I'm not getting my way makes me pretty attractive. I didn't really know what to think at first, but I have the opinion that the universe provides, and because she is/was so reflective and pretty young, she felt a lot like me -- which is the feeling that I like, because I actually like myself -- so I felt good about her. the problem obviously being her age -- and at 11, she was just about to start entering into puberty where her symbolic/logical mind starts to turn on, and the structure that she's been picking up all of her childhood (like how to behave and stuff) starts to conflict with her emotional mind. as an example, it was incomprehensible to her that she couldn't go after something that's so attractive to her (me) just because society says that there are age limits and stuff. so, instead of following what feels good to her, as her logical mind starts to engage, puberty starts because now she the rules say that she can't get/do the things that she wants -- so automatically (because all of her examples fight and complain and push against the rules), she starts fighting all of the rules just like all of her adult examples in her life do (puberty in a nutshell). at the same time as she's starting to fight the structure, I'm learning the opposite, which is to ignore/follow the rules, and instead of feeling bad about the restrictions put on me, to instead find ways to feel the way I want and *attract* good-feeling manifestations, instead of trying to will the way i want it to be. (essentially, I'm attractive to her because I have a capability that she'll want to have when the rule system starts to come crashing in on her good-feeling world with all of the "you can'ts").
I was a bit upset that she showed up and started to wreck things, because my ability to feel good meant that the website was starting to do well and gain traction. also I was learning to work with marcos and be able to perform the tasks that were necessary *inside of his rules*. so I actually was starting to see/believe the website was going to be a success. *finally*, I was going to start creating something I wanted to create (ideological proximity was also one of the things I wanted to add to tuenti) -- and she shows up and starts to cause problems.
after some thinking on it, I decided that if she is what the universe is giving me, and also if I can keep up this pattern of feeling good despite the constraints imposed on m5, I figured it would actually work out -- so I softened to the idea that this could actually be something really awesome the universe is providing me. I talked with marcos very openly about it, and encouraged him to let me start hanging out with her before her puberty started to really derail her mind. I figured that I could help her to see that she can feel the way that she wants to feel *despite the imposed structure*. so, I ended up being fully OK with it. I didn't have any shame about it, and I was fully open about the thing to everyone. I found it quite strange that a young girl would like me, but obviously it would probably have to be that way because the way that parenting is done, is to essentially tell kids that they can't do things, and that they have to behave in a certain way (usually so that the parent isn't caused to feel bad by their behaviour). all older girls will have gone through puberty, and (unless they've learned how to feel good on their own) will be requring conditions (most notably their relationship with me) to make them feel good. I figured it would be impossible to find a girl that's actually able to feel good in spite of the restrictions placed on them by their social and cultural structure -- so obviously, younger it will have to be.
	I should also mention that there are a whole lot of difficulties that remain: I basically have nothing in common with someone so young, and I can't really talk with them about anything that interests me either -- and neither could they actually help me out with stuff that I wanted to work on (back then I was programming most of my waking hours, not like now where I'm pretty idle). so basically we're most entirely incompatible. I had no idea how to solve that problem, other than just figuring it out as I go, and again just sorta finding a way to feel good no matter the situation. I had no idea how it would work out, and I was fairly certain that our extreme incompatibility would cause me to be a pretty terrible boyfriend(?) anyway -- cause mostly all of what I wanted to do was to create something where I was able to find other people who are ideologically and conceptually similar to me. (inotherwords, I wanted to create something that would allow me to find other people I could actually talk and hang around -- someone on my level -- and typically I've found those people to be (sometimes much) older than me). so I was wanting to create something that would obsolete her. also I wanted others to know what I had figured about about how easy it is to attract/manifest things based on how I *feel* about my reality. there was no guarantee that she would have any interest in any of that, so I actually figured it'd be a pretty short relationship too, with her going off to the other (macho/handsome/atheletic) guys that could perform in the ways that she wanted them to perform for her. as much as I wanted it to work, I was quite unsure about the viability of it. too many incompatibilities. on that note though, I'm really actually glad it failed.
after another set of difficulties (the mental institution and getting my right hemisphere turned off), I came to pueblo where the difficulties continued. as you'll eventually read in my really old writings, I didn't know how to get rid of this "nosebook"/"the network" problem, because they were manipulating my life and constantly confining me to have less and less. obviously I hadn't learned the thing that I was intending to teach to andrea so well, because I let my ideas of how nosebook *should* treat me cause me to increase intense amounts of anger (a whole lot of it was experienced watching stars where we were talking tonight), and -- it took me a few years, but I started to really get it. I've been continually pressed more and more to the extreme all the way through my homelessness -- and I'd say that it's only been recently (last few months) where I don't really have any more anger left in me -- and I'm no longer trying to push to get anything I want anymore.
	real quick before I get to the main topic, I'd like to point out that I've figured out that the evolution of desire is essentially *I need (some thing/concept)* -> *I want (some thing/concept)* -> *I'll create (some thing/concept)* -> *I AM (that thing/concept)*. notice how anger is in the *need* category (I *need* someone to be/do something different). the reason why it makes us angry is because it threatens our sense of survival -- because the stuff that we *need* are the things that feel essential to survival. if there's no way to get that thing, that's depression or completely feeling defeated -- but when we're angry, it's a *motivating* force that causes us to feel like it's not completely impossible to get the thing we think we need. wanting is a lot more neutral, but that creates expectatons/beliefs, which when it happens, makes us feel good (like I thought I was going to feel after making tuenti, getting together with raquel, etc), and then there's the idea that "OK, if I can't get it from outside of me, then I'll create it myself". I experienced this multiple times in figuring that I could solve my problem of not being able to find anyone that's even remotely ideologically similar to myself could be solved by *creating* something that would produce the output that I desire. then, finally -- there's the idea that even to create the thing, all creations are an extension of the consciousness of the creator, so therefore, the creator has to have/be/embody the concept that they want to create. inotherwords, if I want something to feel good, I can *need* something to make me feel good, I can *want* something to make me feel good, I can *create* something to make me feel good, or I can *become* someone that feels good.
as I've passed my time in pueblo, I've come to realise that it's just not possible to find that thing outside of myself that I originally wanted. in the months leading up to my homelessness, I outlined a whole bunch of different things that I wanted to create,-- everything from new genetics (with 3X, 6X, or 10X pairs of cromosomes) to an idea where I'd launch a new artifcial moon of earth which would revolve around the equator and do a whole bunch of cool stuff. however,-- like I mentiond above, the reality of me creating these things is pretty slim to none. there's a whole saturnian-system designed to ensure that I must live within the rules that they have for me (ie, they don't want me making any websites or anything like that, and they also ensure that no underage relations ever occur -- or any sex at all, for that matter -- because they run their entire system on my right hemisphere, and sex would totally destroy their system). I don't have the resources to fight the saturnian-system, and at this point neither do I want to. I fully/radically accept their rules, and have any intention of trying to break them. I've passed the point where I can get any manifestation anymore because if that were to happen, it would break all of their rules. all visual/symbolic/astral systems involves rules and a hierarchy that I want nothing of. my destination is 3d, where there are no rules other than attraction. whenever they're ready (ie, when they can't hold back my attraction any further), they'll be forced to let go of me, and something entirely unexpected (something I cannot imagine) will manifest (I have no idea what it'll be). it's worth waiting for, and at this point, it's really not all that hard for me to feel the way I want to feel. I don't need anyone or anything to be different than how they are for me to feel good. therefore, my *only* job is to just feel the way that I want to feel, regardless of the rules. that's it. there's nothing more to it. they'll keep adding more and more rules to ensure to manifestation occurs, and I've come to figure out, *that's what I want* -- because eventually I'll be in the universe where there are no rules; only attraction.
	inotherwords, a manifestation is symbolic and quantifyable, which means it has rules -- so anything of that sort puts me in the universe of rules -- which I don't want. I *refuse* to go to that universe. I don't want rules. I like that things are constantly evolving and changing/improving as a reflection of my perception of it. anyone who tries to get me to go to the world of rules, is essentially trying to break the rules (lol) -- and they'll be stopped, I assure you.
so in closing: all is fine. there will be no underage girls at all, ever. no rules will be broken, and I have no interest in the worlds of higher dimensions. **all things are possible in 3d**

### 2024-12-09 21:04 - some thoughts for tonight

tonight you emitted a few concepts that I felt strongly enough that I wanted to comment on. for now I'll just pick the strongest one, because my intention is to kinda talk it through a bit -- mostly because I don't have a good feeling about it (though I recognise that my bad feeling isn't on the thing itself -- but on my own resistance to the thing). you mentioned how I shouldn't tell abby that I think school is a waste of time. I didn't understand, so I asked you to clarify and you said both that you hated school yourself, and that she also hates it -- however in contrary to the idea you said (essentially) that school is how she will learn, and it'll build character in her. I kinda disagreed by stating (through a story of my own) that the environment is where a lot of kids pick up a lot of resistant behaviour and reactions to authority and stuff. at the same time the thought popped into my head with the the emotion that you expressed your frustration that you can't homeschool her and stuff -- so I thought, "well, OK, but what if she were able to find an alternative where she could learn the things that she wanted." I also wondered had the idea pop into my head, "well, what if I were to teach her" -- and that second one is the one that I experienced so much resistance to. I expressed my reaction/response that resistance by talking to you in the car about how I can't assert my ideas into someone else's life (citing the example of me reflecting my mom), and also by telling you how I don't want to be the motivating force for someone else. I find the people that need someone to motivate them to be pretty much useless
	I think I said "a failure" -- because that concept for me has the implication of failure because a person who isn't self-motivated will judge their success/effectivity of their efforts based on the reaction of the motivator. also, I'm deeply opposed to the idea of motivating anyone because that explicitly makes me 2nd-ray, and I have no desire to be that.
		though it was OK with mom to play 2nd-ray a bit because I'm a reflection of her, so it's not my energy that's pushing her to make the decision that I think will be best, but her own energy that she's emitting toward me being reflected back to her. in that case, just like when I reflect someone else's anger back to them, there's no problem, because it's not m/ own emission -- but theirs. energetically, there's no consequence for me.
	I don't want to become the metric for how someone else perceives their reality, because I'm essentially making a copy of myself (or rather of my ideals). it's really important that everyone has the ability to come to their own conclusions their own unique way. I really feel that it's most important to have their own *desire* to feel good. what I mean is, if it's my desire for them to feel good, I'm their motivator -- and as long as I'm around, I'm the reason for their desire. a person only really becomes attractive when they *want to feel good* (and aren't looking for or using conditions to try and get there (ref: the part where I was talking about your body -- was my translation of the concept that if you actually want to feel good, that's what makes you feel and also look really good)). a person who wants to feel good has a youthfulness and joy about them that's quite notable. it happens to some people on drugs (conditions), and that's why others in that moment appear so much more attractive -- because, the person in that state of "addictive behaviour" *really wants to feel good* (by wanting more of the drug/sex/whatever condition).
		in that sense, (IMO) "addiction" isn't a bad thing -- just a bit misguided, because in that moment, the person thinks that it's the drug or whatever that will make them feel good -- but the important part to the "addictive behaviour" is actully desiring to feel better than they normally do. if a person can take that desire to feel good, and keep it going in sober life, and not use the condition and instead use their thoughts/perception to feel better about their present situation, they'll have figured out what I know, and are fully in control of how they feel. it takes a fair amount of practise, obviously -- because it's just so much easier to look for the condition to do the work of making them feel better, instead of adjusting their perception.
	however, I don't really know how to really instill that concept into someone,-- and it's quite a bit of an "out of the ordinary" perspective on addiction, that most people will fight me on. in their mind, different substances and behaviours are "bad" because they live in the black and white symbolic world of actions and conditions. those sorts of programs are installed by social and cultural (plus influence of family and friends) to ensure that people operate in a way that maintains a semi-orderly system without too much chaos. though my views are significantly different than most of those programs that tell a person how to operate/behave, I've come to those conclusions all by myself -- and though I adhere to them, I absolutely *do not* want to try and teach others to break/disobey the rules that the present social structure is trying to reinforce. also, my view *only works if the person actually wants to feel good for theirself*. nobody can make a person have the desire to feel good without the condition, other than theirself -- so my perspective on these "bad" behaviours are deeply subversive, and I prefer not to teach them to others (though they are the ones that I use myself).
however, let's just suppose for a moment that I were to teach abby or someone else the things that I believe are necessary to navigating life as an attractive person (instead of teaching them to fit into a program, do their work, get old, ugly, then die -- only to be replaced by the next person) -- well, the problem with it is mainly that I would likely be going pretty heavily against their parents (or whoever is responsible for them)'s desire for that person. this, along with many other difficulties, is the main reason why I couldn't be a parent. I would be doing everything all wrong, because I would be often times enabling a person to engage in "bad" behaviour (the same reason why I refuse to be a peer specialist, and keep my mouth shut on so many things regarding this stuff). I don't feel that I would be setting a good example to others, because I'm undermining the social structure that society depends on so much. I don't really feel good giving a kid fire and letting them play with it (though I know they'll be fine, the way it looks to those on the outside is quite problematic).
that's enough of the bad aspects and stuff I'm worried about -- cause there are som5 really good aspects to the idea. the last few weeks I've been going to my dbt class, and I find the emotion regulation module to be ultra complex and completely ineffective (actually yielding opposite results) for an attractive person. each time I go, I regularly think that the whole system out to be able to be simplified down into a form which a child can understand. it's really not all that difficult to understand emotions (IMO), and the last few weeks I've really been thinking a lot on how I could teach emotions to a kid in a simple way that they could understand. I have actually quite a few ideas and the outline/concept of how I would teach it is starting to come together well enough, I may try writing some of it out a bit tomorrow. I'm actually quite exhilerated to find a way to teach it -- because it's going to be something like the difference between imperative programming paradigm (the dbt way) to going to a functional way of programming, where the concepts are recursive. it's sorta hard to explain, but basically I use a system of good/bad feeling concepts, and then the action responses to those feelings are built up on the basic supposition that something that feels good, is something that I turn into action (which often times involves me saying/doing the wrong thing for people) -- and then, trusting my emotions above all else -- which means that when I say/do something wrong/inappropriate and someone trys to make me feel bad for doing something that felt good to me, I have to trust my own feelings over their projection of bad-feeling (which is usually rooted in the symbolic expectations of the social/religious/political/ideological program that they subscribe to). that causes me to have to just "go with it" and *not care what others think* -- just following my own emotions.
	I make it sound easy -- and I told you tonight that I don't really have anything that makes me feel bad anymore, however the thing that I still struggle with (believe it or not) is trying to act and express myself in a way which is least bothersome to others. I really should not give a shit, but that's actually still pretty hard for me. I'm pretty good at not being too embarrassed by stuff that gets misinterpretted by others (that's their problem, and perhaps also none of their business if they were not so interested in trying to ensure that others are behaving/operating "the right way" -- or in accordance with the program).
again, the way that I present the idea of trusting my emotions above everyone else's critisims and attempts to get me to build and/or adhere to a structure that pleases them, is again pretty subversive and problematic for the maintenance and endurance of the social/political/religious structures that are in place (and expected that all well-behaving citizens are supposed to adhere to). again, I know from personal experience that trying to adhere to those structures just simply doen't work at all for me, usually creating bigger problems. going at my speed, which is true for all attractive people (who don't temper their emotions, just letting them manifest, because there isn't sufficcient time to try and change them) will have increasing difficulty fitting into any structure at all. I believe *my way* is *the only way* (lol) to effectively navigate at those speeds, because manifestations happen so fast. with manifestations occurring that quickly, they're just impossible to be too proactive about by "setting up boundaries" or trying to create logic for how they should happen. I can only proactively setup my responces to whatever happens like "not my problem" or "nothing I can do about that" (instead of feeling guilt/embarrassment/shame for not adhering to the program). those methods all sound like "cop outs", and probably from an external perspective of someone looking in from the outside would believe that I'm just telling people to shift the blame to others by pointing out that they attracted my (unwanted) behaviour -- whereas from my perspective, I really would have loved to know when I was a kid that being low resistance, means that my body feels like the people that I'm interacting with and *the way my environment feels isn't the way that I feel* -- and that *my body isn't my emotions*.
inotherwords,-- though I think that it would be a whole lot of fun to teach someone else what I know, I really dislike the amount of disruption that it'll have on society as a result. as I mentioned in the previous letter, my goal is to try my best to not need the rules to change, lowering my resistance and having as little effect on the installed structures as possible. I don't want to bring any more chaos and destruction than I'm already doing -- and if I were to actually teach someone what I would know,-- and let's say that a significant enough people actually took my advice,-- this creates a truly disastrous situation for those that want to maintain the structure. my goal has always been to create a low-impact way for others to gradually learn what I know, not be destructive by being subversive. as it stands, I think I prefer not to directly influence anyone else to do what I do. perhaps as soon as things start to really fall apart, there will be more desire to know what I know. I prefer for (as attraction speeds increase) people to begin asking me about what I think is an effective way of navigating (ie, me responding to their desire) rather than telling everyone "the secret".

### 2024-12-10 18:37 - photons and science

yesterday night (actually it was this morning) at the end of our conversation you sent me a video about gravitational waves, which sent me into a rant about science. I said, "why can't they just call a photon an electron" -- or something like that. I also said that I prefer to do my own science research by just looking at and trying to figure out the concepts for myself, rather than relying/waiting on science to give me the answer. your comment was that was my ego talking -- and while I do have a good sized ego, my frustration with science and that sort of thing stems from my desire to figure out the fractal nature of how the (physical) universe is built (I don't much care about the subatomic stuff, cause it's not necessary). I *know* (and there's an overwhelming amount of evidence to support the idea) that the universe is fractal in nature, and different structures and arrangements repeat theirselves (with slight differences) over different size scales. not only do I want to know more about how our solar system works, I also want to compare and contrast that to things on the atomic scale.
presently (and I'll be pleasantly surprised to find out I'm wrong) I don't know of any science source that actuallly talks about the mechanics of the atom and the electron in any detailed way. so, for example I believe that the solar system is a pretty good starting point for figuring out the atom. the sun is like the proton in the middle -- which presently science says that different atoms have more than one proton in them, which works out numerically, (and I'm not saying that there aren't abnormal atoms that have binary/trinary nuclear systems to them (like sirius has essentiall two protons at its centre)) but I think it probably better fits the solar system model that we see around that the quanitiy of protons that are found in the nucleus is actually the *size* of the nucleus, just like all around the galaxy we find some stars that are larger and some that are smaller -- but they tend to have only a single star or a binary companion (though it's also my belief that atoms with a binary proton systems do exist and  are a "special" type of atom which usually doesn't occur -- but they can and do in certain situations). I think electrons are pretty similar to planets/comets, as they're solid bodies that travel with inertia. there's pretty good evidence that this is the case too, because the basic electron orbitals are on the orbiting plane of the proton (ie, around its equator) -- with some orbiting as if they're moons to the proton (ie, like mercury/venus), then wih others on a farther out orbit (like jupiter/saturn/uranus/neptune), and also as the neutron gets heavier and more complex, there are some orbitals that are steeply inclined like you'd see a comet. it just makes sense that those electrons/planets must obey similar rules.. so, for example, whatever rule it is that causes a planet to go from the outer orbital (like neptune) and to start taking on a more inclined orbit will probably give some insight into why pluto's (or more extreme eris and gongong) orbit is so inclined.
the orbits of the planets in our solar system are extremely slow when compared to atoms (which means they're at a much higher frequency -- think of how bass is like 20-100 cycles per second, plants orbits are in cycles per year, which is an extremely long wavelength) so we can think of the orbits of electrons as happening considerably faster (probably trillions of times per second or something -- maybe faster). that type of vibration is around a centre (the proton), so the wave that it produces (ie, the way that it perturbs the medium arund it) is going to be one kind of wave. also, we see that planets rotate along an axis as well. additionally, there's another axis as well, which is the poles -- and the planet doesn't need to rotate along its polar axis. that's three different influences that will act on the outer medium as well. none of these are explained -- because an electron rotating an axial tilt will have a far different effect than one rotating directly on it's axis (is this sorta like how light is "polarised" with some amount of the photons/electrons rotating same as the axis and some rotating perpendivular to the axis? I don't fully know). 
furthermore, I know (though I can't find any scientific documentation on it) that as the sun/proton increases its output, the electron/planet will increase its rotational speed, becoming more and more energetic [that's actually one of my theories for why many parts of earth have been relocated to farther out planets/moons in the solar system -- and why there have been calendar changes around the roman times (they added two months) and also around the time of shakespere], and so if increasing the rotational speed of the planet has some effect, I would imagine that this dramatically increases its output/emission as it goes to a higher frequency.
I suspect that the spin rate of the electron/planet/photon determines its emission spectrum (ie, the faster it spins, the more it "blueshifts"), so for now I'll just take that to be the way that it is. when an electron gets going fast enough, we see that a photon is emitted (consider the condensation reactions presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSWshPEF8Dk) for some ideas). well, after the photon/electron is emitted, the electron "relaxes" into a lower orbital. that gives me a number of questions: namely -- did the electron go flying off and start traveling through the medium -- and if it does, then does the imbalance that is now felt in the solar/proton system cause the proton to emit a huge "solar flare" which then coalesces into another planet/electron which settles into in the lower energy orbital. or, if no electron ever leaves the proton/solar system, what causes the electron to go down into a lower orbital? let's say that the proton/star's solar flare is the origin of the photon -- well, then that means that the light received somewhere else is nothing other than the vibration of the medium and not the electron itself. that would create a whole lot more questions too, because it would mean that light can only be perceived as vibrations in the medium, and that outside of earth the light won't be seen in the same way because the medium is going to be at a different density (for example, in the solar medium, it's quite possible that the emitted vibrations from distant stars would be at likely a much higher frequency (propagating at a much faster speed than the speed of light)). that would mean that the spin of the planet/electron (or maybe it's the proton that's emitting) is causing these waves to propagate in the medium. I'd want to know about that -- and what exactly is this medium made up of? is it more proton-like things which exist at the subatomic scale, or what?
I have a lot of questions, and I'd really like science to present some insight into what's happening -- because spin determines everything. there are also these things that are called "cosmic rays" which are like really high energy electrons that are blasting through the medium at nearly the speed of light. I imagine that these are something like what we consider electricity to be -- electrons that are blasted off or attracted to some source. do those things emit in all directions? like for example, are cosmic rays coming off of the sun in all directions, being attracted to the heliosphere? I would suspect so, because then that means that the highest frequency and most attractive part of the sun is out in this sphere that surrounds the solar system. if there really is this really high frequency sphere of attractive protons(?) surrounding the solar system, then that would be like a really attractive reflector, where when the solar wind and other stuff makes it out there, it'll impact this spherical reflector at high speeds, blasting the particle to bits producing a bunch of high frequency smaller particles, and bouncing/reflecting all of the larger bits back in toward the star again (which probably circle in to the star at the poles, because I know (and is pretty obvious) that the most attractive part of the star (ie, it's high frequency attractive protons) are all in the very core of the star (ie, the "white dwarf" part -- with all of the emissive protons being the majority outer layers of the star)). do atoms have such a reflector around them as well?
next, let's just say that electricity is just an electron that has a pull on it that's sufficient for it to be pulled out of orbit from its proton/star, that electron will fly off in the direction of the source of its attraction (which could just be another proton that's missing electrons or some other thing) -- well, then there's still a lot more questions here, because that proton, having been in orbit to a proton will still have a lot of the same rotational velocity as it leaves, which means that it'll still be spinning, and it's position that it was in when it left the proton is going to give a very different quality to this electron flying toward whatever's attracting it. let's say the electron has no axial tilt to it, and it's spinning one direction (say CCW from top-down), how does that interact with protons that are spinning in the opposite direction? do they get repelled by the proton producing the perpendicular "magnetic" wave, or do they go crashing into the proton (I feel like some sort of statistics on the spin of sun-diving comets relative to the rotation of the sun and the comets trajectory might give some insight into this). there are other cases too -- like what if the electron has axial tilt -- and what if the axial tilt is so extreme that its polal and/or rotational axis is pointed at the sun/proton (like uranus), does the eletron go shooting off spinning like a bullet going through a rifled barrel with its pole pointed at the source of it's attraction -- and if it does, then what kind of wave does this create? is that what magnetism is? I just don't know.
it's worth noting that, now that I've asked all of these questions, I'm sure that the answers will make their way to me, so I won't be ignorant forever. however, I'm only making the point here that there's just so much to all of these vibrations, that a simple "wave function" isn't good enough for me. there are so many ways that something can vibrate (I mentioned at least 4 above), and also for there to be wave propagation of any kind, there needs to be a liquid/gas medium where things can bounce off one another, or a vibrational lattice involved somewhere. it's not *just* a photon.

###	2024-12-12 21:18 - parenting and selfishness

today two themes appeared quite redily: parenting and selfishness. the first (parenting) happened because I was upstairs and I forget how we got on the topic, but nick was talking about his two girls, and he seemed pretty proud of the younger one. unfortunately, I was a little bit shocked and not wanting the same thing for myself. he must have noticed my reaction because he asked if I would want kids of my own (essentially, because I can shape them to be however I want them to be (probably like his younger one, because the older he said he didn't even get to meet her until she was 14)). I was horrified at the prospect of having kids -- and even more at the prospect of shaping them to my will. I started to launch off into a discussion about why I don't want to tell anyone else what to do, but somehow we ended up on another topic (I think something about wikka as the original religion). then on the walk home multiple times (probably caused by people passing me in cars -- I often times pick up on their thoughts/reactions to things I say as they approach me). so, multiple times I was thinking about what it would like to be a parent. the final key to this introduction, is the concept that nick said that he thought that parenting would be hard, but for him it was like an instinct -- to which I responded that may be the case, but apparently I'm one of those humans that doesn't seem to share the same "common sense" or instinct that other humans have.
if I were a parent, I would teach my kids to always do what they want to do, and to pay attention to how things feel. inevitably, because I share genetics with them, I'll be pretty in-tune to what they're feeling, so it'll be pretty easy for me to watch/feel them from a distance and would be able to point out how their emotions were always an indicator of how the thing would turn out. then, inevitably after a few interactions with regular humans fails miserably, and some human tries to make them feel bad for their behaviour, I'd point out that other humans are constantly trying to affect behaviour by making their offender feel as bad as possible for what they did (to cause them to conform to what they think is "right" -- aka, adults parenting adults). additionally, I'd want them to learn (and they will after a few fails) that trying to please others and conform to their idea of what is "good" or "bad" is essentially a never-win situation (which is why they should always do what they want and not worry about how others are reacting to them). I'd also teach them the important aspect of always trusting their emotions above all else: if whatever it was felt good to them, no matter how awful the circumstances turn out (ie, how much destruction they caused) or how bad others are trying to make them feel for whatever it was they said/did,-- to just trust that their emotion is their security that things will eventully turn out fine (even if a few structures crash and burn in the process). they'll eventually figure out that the way that we navigate time is *emotionally*; and turning a good feeling into action is *always* going to be fine in the long-term. there's never anything to worry about, so they can *always* ignore all of the silly humans that are trying so hard to get others to behave the way they want them to.
once they've figured out how to follow their emotions, it's then time to start working on perception: take any situation that feels bad -- and it's possible to find a way to feel good about the same situation. the reason for that, is that every single concept has both attraction and emission aspects to it [the difference is which one is on the outside/inside and both have counter-rotation to each other -- causing that internal conflict] -- and the stuff that's attracted can *always* feel good in some way. even if someone is attracting terrible things into their life, it's *always* what they desire (fear is just desire for something "bad" to happen). when looking at what a person is attracting, it doesn't matter what it is that they're attracting, if it's unwanted, the impacts of whatever it is that's unwanted *always* produces a higher frequency concept which *is wanted* -- so even a person who only has the maximum amount attraction of unwanted will eventually (whether they like it or not) get something that they want. it's absolutely inevitable. it's not possible to attract only unwanted forever -- because eventually the wanted aspect will be attracting more powerfully than the unwanted aspect (those manifestations, btw are usually pretty funny to watch because something wanted manifests in a person's life, but because they're so powerfully attracting unwanted stuff, the manifestation is quite a difficult/rough experience with lots of turmoil). so, eventually, everyone *will* get what they want, *whether they like it or not* -- which means they can *always* **ignore the manifestation and only care about how they feel**.
	this is also why I go for the "worst" on everything -- because I know that even if it's the worst, it can't last forever. as soon as my attraction of wanted superceedes my expectation of the "worst", it's impossible for something wanted not to manifest. the desire to get the worst, is only saying, "I'm going to try and hold out till the very very end, when my attraction of wanted (kinda like an orgasm) is far beyond the efforts of the "worst" to make me feel bad". this happens to everyone, and the key factor here is that if I can feel great even in the "worst",-- then when the attracted thing finally manifests, the manifestation will feel *way way better* than the way I felt about the "worst" (which can be bad/meh/good/great) -- so, if I already feel great when it manifests, the manifestation is at least 2X better than it would be otherwise (cause good+great is much better feeling than meh+great). this is the lesson that's encoded in the book of gob.
[brb - 22:12] the final aspect that I think is absolutely essential to teach a kid is to value their selfishness. there's no other person that's more important than theirself. whatever they want to do, they should do. I still struggle with this a bit myself, so I'm perhaps not the best example (and I think this is best taught by example) -- cause I still care too much about how others feel. I really need to stop doing that, because it causes me to modify my behaviour in responce to how others feel/react. I don't want to constantly be trying to modify my behaviour in order to please others. it's completely unnecessary -- and I'm still learning. there's a very fine line between playing within the rules so as to not cause too much disruption, and people pleasing. the difference is attraction vs emission, and I'm still learning how to maintain my selfishness without causing too many problems for others (ie, not emitting -- which is affecting others to conform to my idea of good/bad). worrying about how others will react to me or being sad when things go wrong is another one of m/ weak points. I need to stop caring completely and embrace full selfishness. I'd try and promote that my kids are even more effective at being self-centred selfish desire machines caring only about therselves.
	as an example: I don't want to worry about anyone else when they're having a hard time, because worry is causing me to feel uneasy about something that I have no power over. I like the feeling that everything is easy, and just cause someone else doesn't find the thing easy, doesn't mean that I should cause myself to feel their uneasyness/uneasement by worrying about them. they're perfectly capable of figuring it out for theirselves, and the way that I feel is the *only* thing that I should ever worry about, ever. I can just simply desire for their improvement and/or to feel the same ease that I feel. however again, transmitting that concept to another person is somewhat difficult, because I think kids learn and pick this up by example, mostly by watching those around them (words aren't too effective here -- cause kids can feel an adult's desire pretty easily -- and they know whether the adult's desire is for the other person's improvent or destruction).
the only thing they should be desiring and paying any attention to, is *improvements* -- and I'd try to teach them to tune out others focusing on problems, or to make a sort of distanced sarcastic response to the situation. there's nothing that they can do about the other person -- and they're just going to continue to complain and point out the problems in the world. I'd teach them the fine art of "saying the right response" like "I hope you feel better" and stuff like that -- but mostly just to ignore all of that, and only give their attention to people and their improvements (even if they find that person disagreeable or unwanted in some way -- only notice the things that are getting better). again, this is another one that kids learn by example, and I'm not quite there yet myself. I really need to get better at poking fun at people with problems. I still try to people-please too much and still attempt to try and "say the right thing" (even though I don't really mean it).
the difficulty with teaching someone that they should always do what they want and should pay attention to their emotions above everything else, is that I'd be raising "demon children" -- kids that don't conform very well to society's expectations (which I would also tell them to completely ignore, only going after what feels good to them). trust me when I say that growing up with such a mindset is completely detestable to normal humans -- so much so that I essentially hid who I really was all the way up until only pretty recently. I'd give hints and indicators to others that I have a massive ego but I kept it mostly on the DL. society is designed to ensure that *nobody* grows up to have the perspective that I have. it's the most hated thing ever, and causes endless competition and rivalry (which is why I don't compete). it's not easy to grow up with that kind of a concept of the universe [btw, for those interested, that concept of the universe was originally what was put into my right hemisphere after I had the brain haemorrhage (2000). it got too powerful and was shut down in 2017, and since I've rebuilt an even more selfish and desirous version of that 1st-ray perspective in my left hemisphere]. the new version of that concept is even more ridiculous than the original RH template.
I don't really want to put someone else through having a perspective like the one that I have. I'm so certain that it'd be such a massive failure and would cause such immense disruption, *I absolutely won't do it at all*. I intend to play by the rules and cause as little friction/emission as possible. if others want want to do that, it's fine by me, but I can't in my (only-attraction) perspective try to teach anyone else to be like that. they can certainly watch me and copy the parts that they like (or if they ask, I'll be willing to illuminate the idea with my experience/insight), but *I'm not going to go out of my way to teach someone to be like that*. **if someone wants to be like that, they'll make the choice to be like that theirself**.
the other difficulty that I have with trying to teach/steer someone to be like that, is that to actually be effective at it, *you have to have a high opinion of yourself*. it doesn't seem to be an inherited trait (both of my parents are notably tempered to not have their ego intact) -- and some kids just don't have any self-worth or value, no matter how much I try to convince them otherwise. so assuming I were able to teach them all of the stuff mentioned above, I don't think I can effectively teach them to actually have a high opinion of theirself. most people only have a high opinion of theirself when they have the manifestation to prove it to the world. it takes a whole nother level of narcisism to still value yourself and think you're the most awesome, even with nothing to show for yourself. I don't know how to teach that -- and that's kinda the essential ingredient.

### 2024-12-14 14:55 - thinking	about yesterday's reactions

yesterday was interesting. the first person I saw was tommy, I wished him a nice trip and forgot to thank him for suggesting the hot sauce, cause it's absolutely amazing on egg sandwiches (funny thing is, he said something like, "I'm giving this to you cause it's what I'd want to have" -- a pretty cool reflection). after that I saw nick and he asked me if I was in more trouble or less trouble today. I didn't know what he was talking about because I didn't say anything bad about him at all (only noticed what I think he was implying that his younger daughter turned out more like him than the older one did because he got her when she was younger -- which I have no idea how that could possibly get me into trouble at all). I responded that I think I'm in less trouble because yesterday was definitely better than wednesday, cause mom's anger seems to have subsided.
	I explained to her that I was so nice to be around when I was low resistance because I wasn't trying to go any direction at all (not even away from her house), and as soon as she told me that I have to go to this facility that doesn't feel good to me and said that I'd prefer to go to the streets, because the direction she's having me go doesn't feel good to me (low resistance doesn't mean doing what others say, but going only in the direction of what feels good (resistance feels bad) -- so I'm fine following anyone else's directions for me until they start to feel bad) -- then since now I have to find my own way, I've got to begin resisting again. the way that I determine to be the best one (ie, the one that feels good to me) is the way that I have to go, resisting efforts for others to make me go that way. I don't like to make my own way because of how much resistance it requires. I prefer the only-attraction technique, which is just following what feels good to me and when new things that feel good to me come to me, just go with the flow of whatever feels good/neutral (even if they weren't the original way that I thought I had to go).
he looked at me a little bit funny with that response, cause perhaps it seemed perhaps that I was actually getting into more trouble. I thought about it a little more -- and again, I don't see what I could have gotten into trouble about -- but then I remembered what [I wrote yesterday afternoon](../plastic-kenny/conceptual-thinking.md#2024-12-13-1111---migranes-and-stars) [though I may be mixing memories here, the concept is the same: I remembered that I wrote a bunch of scientific stuff] -- and perhaps that's pretty problematic because maybe someone doesn't want others knowing how the conceptual stuff works, limiting science to the EM spectrum and the speed of light (concepts transcend space and time -- so modifying a concept in the past/future, also changes it now, thereby modifying all timelines based off of that concept) so, if there are various private/government organisations that are using time based technology by tuning-in to and altering concepts to manipulate the present, it's quite likely that they'd want to keep how that stuff works a bit of a secret, even though all of the answers to how it works can be seen when looking at the stars and how they work. oops. "OK, maybe I did cause a bit of trouble a little bit, I dunno", I responded. I got my coffee and went to AccuDetox where I met a guy (patrick) who invited me to a super cool flute concert, which I really enjoyed. when I got home, and as I was falling asleep, I started to rethink a lot of those reactions...
the first thing I thought of is that perhaps what he meant by being in trouble is that perhaps I wasn't supposed to tell you how I would raise kids, because then now it's pretty obvious that I'm clearly not suitable for the job (cause nobody wants to be around other people that are as selfish as I am). society and social structrures are designed to ensure that people don't end up being as selfish as I am. they want you to *do what they want you to do* -- not what you want to do. teaching someone to go against evverything that we're taught is highly problematic and highly undesirable. -- inotherwords, the subtext/implication here, is that if I had the opportunity to be a parent in some way -- it would have been advantageous for me to start teaching them selfishness and get as much taught before the saturnian-system caught on and takes the child away from me. I don't want to be subversive, so I (like the illuminati) project my actions out into the future to ensure that anyone who wants to stop them, can. I understand that by clearly stating my intentions, I probably wrecked any chance I had of ever being a parent -- which was my exact intention. **I don't want to tell others what to do, so I refuse to be a parent**. I don't even want the illusion of it, and I prefer not to try and tease others with the illusion of it either. the irony of it is, if someone wants to learn selfishness, *they have to be selfish enough to learn it theirself*. if I were to "teach selfishness" -- they wouldn't actually be selfish -- because they're still following someone else's guidance (mine in this case). *to be truly selfish, they have to actually desire to go the way that feels good to them* -- more than they want to please people or fulfill others' expectations.
the other thing that I felt could be linked to being in trouble is the concept of "not wanting to tell others what to do" -- because, I feel like this is a pretty big sticking point for a lot of girls/women. (perhaps it's the TV's fault but) they want some guy to come in and just take charge and tell them what to do. I think this is actually one of the leading causes for what attracts a woman to be raped. she wants a guy to come in and tell her what to do -- so then, that's what happens -- and instead of enjoying what she attracted, our modern social structures tell women that rape is bad and that they should feel bad, including shame and disgust for it. I don't see it as anything other than a fulfillment of their desire.
	the manifestation of anything always reflects the way that a person feels. so, if she's feeling fear and stuff or if she feels like she needs to fight against it in some way -- it's pretty likely that the situation will turn violent and stuff (cause from the male's perspective, he's being required/attracted to tell/get her to do the thing that will make him feel good -- and if she doesn't want to comply, that quickly turns into anger and rage). if she could just settle in to whatever's happening and just feel the pleasure of the moment, it'd be a different experience (ie, she'd be on a whole different timeline, likely with a whole different guy -- everything from a classy hotshot that thinks he's a mack daddy, all the way to a guy that really likes her, and the only way he thinks he can get what he wants from her is to force it on her physically). the way that you feel, and the things that you expect "from a guy like him" will dramatically determine the timeline that you experience. all timelines are possible, but most women are trained to be scared of men they don't know and to expect the worst from them. it's kinda unfortunate, but -- whatever -- such is the society we live in (and the saturnian-system ensures that we're always expecting the worst -- even me).
unfortunately, I'm not one of those people that likes to tell others what to do -- and the only times I've really ever done it is when it's been attracted/expected of me (or when I'm a reflection of another person who likes to tell others what to do -- but then again, that too is attraction), so which is why I'm completely incapable of doing "what women want" for them. women who want to be told what to do are looking for guys that will do that sort of thing. I watched this all the time in spain (where this sort of "machismo" is ubiquitous -- where even they have daytime TV programs where it's one male chef telling a bunch of women how to cook) -- and the guy that would go in, be all handsy with her, and was able to find the most clever way of manipulating her into bed with him was always the winner. the saying "nice guys finish last" always resonated with me, and it was sorta one of those things that I just expected to be the case. I'm a "nice guy" in the sense that I'm not trying to manipulate women or tell them what to do, so I never got anywhere.
watching all of these extremely attractive women go for all this machismo all of the time caused me to build up enough desire that I was finally able to manifest patricia and raquel -- but it was one of those "pretty funny to watch because something wanted manifests in a person's life, but because they're so powerfully attracting unwanted stuff, the manifestation is quite a difficult/rough experience with lots of turmoil" -- which is exactly what happened. my focus/attention on how these super macho guys would go in there and manipulate these girls into bed with them, caused me to really dislike "machismo" -- which, then was no surprise that both patricia and raquel expected it from me and also figured that I too was that way. after having paid so much attention to that kind of unwanted form of attraction, that was literally all I saw. I didn't have any relationships in m/ life that I could positively identify as something that I'd want to have. I couldn't see a way to get what I want and it bothered m5 quite a lot. I turned asexual after realising that I am actually pretty "machista". I was beginning to see how incompatible my growing selfishness was -- and I essentially wanted a woman to be there when I need her to be there, no matter how much I neglect her and do my own thing otherwise, also open my eyes to new ideas and show me cool new perspectives of how to look at something -- oh yeah, and also make me feel good at any time that I wanted her to (with only a minimum of a few minutes prep time before she's ready to go). I didn't really want a girlfriend -- but a drug. deciding that I didn't really want to do that anymore, I decided that my best option is not to rely on anyone else to make me feel good anymore. I'd never before told anyone what to do or relied on someone else to make me feel good before I met raquel/patricia. having had that happen to me where I converted into the thing that I hated so much (ie, someone "machista") was one of my most regrettable realisations. sure, I could blame them and say that it was what they were attracting from me -- but the fact of the matter still remains that it's sorta true.
	additionally, I noticed that (even though I've supposedly experienced really intensely pleasurable experiences during sex), the sexual experience is quite painful for me. I don't like the feeling of orgasm, and all along the way there's tons of discomfort that I experience as well. the only real redeeming quality of it is how I feel for the days/hours afterward. to me, it's kinda like smoking a joint: the smoke is harsh and the experience isn't pure pleasure, but the way I feel afterward is quite nice (or the stinging feeling of coke in the nose/throat -- or I imagine like poking yourself with a needle before heroin/blues). it's always that "small amount of pain to get to the pleasure" tradeoff that I'm not so fond of.
it just feels a whole lot more responsible to me to just use drugs when I want a condition to make me feel better. I can control it, and I can do it *whenever I want*. I don't need to try and get anyone else into the mood to do what I want to do -- and I don't need to play a bunch of games either. the only person I'm dealing with, *is myself* -- so it makes it a whole lot easier to do what I want to do (all of the time). when there's another person around, I either need to be full leader and tell them what to do, or I need to just follow them around and do what they want to do. I want to do what I want to do (what feels good to me), and I don't want to tell others what to do -- so I either need to be alone, or (impossibly) find someone who can read my mind and only wants to do what I want to do (lol). obviously that's not going to work, so it appears that being alone/asexual is the obvious answer. I'm too selfish to try and integrate myself into a relationship anymore (I *only* want to do what feels good to m5).
I'd like to tell you a weird story that I thought of this morning which kinda illuminates the dynamics here. a long time ago (this is a remix on the sumerian story -- with some more truth added), the martians (who were originally black) were building a slave race of humans. enki had the job -- and enki is kinda like my brother jaron. he was (at that time) a nearly perfect symbolic reflection of the martians and their desires (to emit and tell others (the new slaves) what to do). ninhursag/anatau (-1) was his wife, but she was a lot like me. she was so selfish that she didn't want anything to do with enki and had no desire to tell anyone what to do (or be told what to do). she did her own thing and that caused enki a whole lot of difficulties, because she was like super duper hot, and enki really wanted to jump on that and get her to fulfill all of his sexual fantasies. using the astral system provided by the XX system (astral just means a wave confined to a dimension, which produces standing-waves -- which produces the extra dimension), enki was able to take the pure selfish copies of ninhursag and (in the earliest version of the saturnian-system (which is just the regulation of the space between earth and the ionosphere/sun for the extra dimension (venus was added later around the time of the greeks for another extra dimension)), which uses symbolic/subatomic logic/systems to affect things conceptually). ninhursag agreed to birth a few children from her own egg -- which was a pretty big failure, because those models were too selfish, wanting to always do their own thing, they weren't able to be steered and guided by the martians. since anatau and her daughters are completely driven by their emotion, it proves effective to build symbolic systems which are able to change how they feel in responce to different conditions. he didn't want anything like anatau (sycorax / wicked witch of the west archetype)), so he begins to program these girls to have positive conceptual/emotional feedback to someone telling them what to do and to taking charge of their life -- and negative feedback (like shame and guilt) for stuff that they would do which would cause problems and division amongst them (like sleeping with a rival mars/enemy). each time that they were misbehaving, the saturnian-system would be reprogrammed to ensure that they would follow the rules and obey the laws (this is where the institution of marriage and the idea that the woman is property of the man came from). in general, the earth girls (as created by enki) were a large success, because they learned to love being told what to do, and to have others arrange their life for them so they didn't need to come up with their own desire.
		there were a few different revisions of the first humans. some of them were not a whole lot more intelligent than the apes that their genetics came from -- and really little ability to follow directions. they needed a solution to give the humans the ability to see temporally (instead of only now) so that they can follow orders and oversee things as happening over time (instead of only doing what feels good to them now like selfish brats). the sun offers that ability, so they then mixed earth (X) with the sun (Y) (which is why the early slavs/slaves were white) and that allowed the martians (XX) to give the mercury (XY) humans directions using the "saturnian-system" of that time (it was far less advanced than it is now). using astral, they could influence the mercuries conceptually, making certain tasks and actions feel good, and others feel bad. that solved the workforce problem
	after the crash, there were endless wars amongst the aryans (the new white guys that the martians had now bread into, which looking like mercury now, having mars (XX) capability which is the ability to use the megalithic/astral systems to control the XY mercuries), the main thing that happened is that without enki's unified/monolithic system in place anymore, there quickly grew massive amounts of dissention between the martians, creating many different factions. they would go to war all the time, and (as is usual), after slaughtering all of the warriors in the town, raping their women/girls was the warrior's reward. it was kinda a funny thing that's happening there because these poor women would be so dissatisfied with something different than their husband, and unable to effectively express herself and her desire for something different, she'd start attracting the next raiding party to come through and kill her husband. this cycle continued for quite a bit, and after enough of these guys having all of these "unloyal" women around them, the men's desire rose to such a level that they wanted a woman smart enough to be able to follow symbolic logic and be "loyal" to him -- which jupiter provided in the form of venus (which extended the saturnian-system further (creating an extra logic layer between the sun and mercury: venus) which caused a lot of havoc in the solar system for a while).
	the sumerian saturnian-system is now competing with the new greek saturnian-system, and it eventually wins (most of all science and maths we use is based on the greek system, not the sumerian system). it's pretty easy to see that back in an age of very low technology, a woman with a miserable husband just desires a more physically capable husband than the previous (bigger and stronger -- cause what else is there) -- and venus is a bit of a different species which changed things considerably because she's now able to start coming to rational conclusions about what she wants, instead of just wanting a bigger/stronger hunk. this symbolic system that established by venus/athena where an improvement was figured out logically was (IMO) the major difference that the greeks had over the sumerians, and what caused them to flourish so much in sciences and technology.
though I could have done a better job with the story (some things are out of order and it's a bit long), what I'd like to illuminate here is that originally earth girls were just designed to be a reflection of the martians, which were a bunch of dissatisfied emitters trying to get everyone else to solve their problems and do their work for them. they were very beautiful because anatau is very attractive/beautiful -- however, they were trained away from their attractive qualities, by learning to follow their emotional programming. after a while of doing whatever someone else wants a person to do, it's the usual responce to then want to tell someone else what to do (so that I'm the one giving orders, not taking them). it's very normal to want to do thing that's been done to me back to the person that's done it (this is the reflective aspect of the saturnian-system, originally taught by venus/athena: instead of just taking it, stand up for yourself and do it back to them).
the next thing I'd like to point out is that the same thing that happened to enki is happening again. like anatau, I'm 1st-ray, which means that I'm fully selfish. no matter how hard enki desired for ninhursag to have sex with him, attepting every manipulation he could think of, he couldn't make it happen. the reason for it is obvious: she couldn't become like him; her attraction to feel good was so strong, that feeling like enki does is an impossibility to her. she refused to be physical with him, and instead offered her offspring instead (for whom she's the super-consciousness of). I don't care what the kens will do -- cause they'll figure out (like I did) eventually that they don't want to tell others what to do -- so it's all fine. meanwhile, it's quite nice to think of the idea that they (like the earth girls did) will become a reflection of their emitters, and will be fully capable of telling others what to do again (in fact, there are a lot of the original martian entities that are still around today using my genetics -- and they're definitely doing a lot of steering and affecting of behaviour).
I cannot (under any circumstance) ever go back to having sex again. the reason is obvious: patricia and then later raquel was perfect for me. she got me in infinite space. every day I'm alive, I go faster than the previous day. this will carry on forever, as the saturnian-system as essentially killed me, yet I remain alive. there's nothing that can stop me anymore. I will continue to go faster forever. if I have sex with someone, I will go *really really really fast*, and I'm not looking to go faster because every time that I even go a little bit faster (like smoke meth or something), the counter-measures that the system has to put on me to slow me back down or create a whole lot of unwanted to balance out how much wanted I feel, just isn't plausible. it's not like I'm the martians and I can build a slave race to produce enough unwanted to balance out all of the awesome conditions that I have. I'm not an emitter. additionally, *I don't like the feeling of sex*, and the way that I feel all the time now is way better than anything sex has to offer. I prefer to feel better and better all the time (ie, infinite and continually going faster). like ninhursag, I don't want to go back to sex, because if I did, I get put back into the symbolic system, where things are getting older and decaying (if they don't resonate with the constrained vibrations). I don't like the way that makes me feel and I don't want to affect other people (which would certainly happen if I were to have sex). I did come up with a way to make it possible for me to have sex (essentially make all of the emissive parts of my body (hair, teeth, eyes, etc) no longer emit physically by multiplying the vibrational speeds of the emitted particles/electrons by an ever-increasing amount until they essentially disappear) -- but I can't make that happen without becoming an emitter, so I have to hope that venus coordinates with me or does it for me.
	plus, it wouldn't be all that great either,-- because since I'm no longer emitting, the feeling experienced by the woman would be only her own (and the physical sensation produced by the body) -- and I wouldn't be making her feel much better/different than she already does. also, for me there'd be next to no sensation either -- kinda just a rubbing feeling and that's it. I would however feel the woman's conceptual system like I do now -- though I wonder how much of that is a reflection of my conceptual system -- which I guess is pretty nice because I do like how I feel. I dunno actually, cause now that I think about it, maybe a lot of the pain that I experience is the physical stuff going at too fast of a speed. I dunno, maybe it'd be better -- who knows -- but it's essential for me to eventually have that
finally, the last thing that I felt is a kind of depression -- cause there just isn't a way to get what's wanted out of me. I'm sure that'll be figured out eventually, but for now, it's just not possible for me to do much more of the normal human stuff. [brb, I need a break; forgot the conclusion (or the concept has evolved)]

### 2024-12-15 18:33 - feeling bad about something we don't have control over

hi, I ended the last entry a bit abruptly and intended to come back to it, but the conclusion that I originally had, essentially vanished. usually that means that the concept has evolved -- which is fine. since I couldn't find the new version, I just left it. I figured that I'd figure it out later and started watching math videos. I slept pretty much all day today and just now took my adderall, so I could do some thinking and writing about stuff that I've been intending to write about. anyway, as I was thinking about it this evening, again I was able to feel the feeling of depression again -- so this is kinda like an extended conclusion.
originally I wasn't	going to write that weird and long story to you, but I decided to do it because one of the concepts that's often come up when writing or thinking about writing to you is the topic of how the earth is a balanced system,-- and so to ensure that it stays balanced, there's this thing called the saturnian-system (which I did I [a pretty good explanation of it to naomi](/dear-naomi.md#2024-12-10-1353---a-few-flaws)), which is designed to ensure that as much "bad" stuff happens as possible. the reason for this is to essentially generate as black/white absorbtion/emission spectrum as possible. what that means is that all frequencies of all concepts are to be explored in every way. the reason for this is so that the earth is attractive to all things -- both the good and the bad. good has a lot of problems to it, because it's easy to get "stuck in a rut" and only go after a certain set of "good" things (like, if you play a game, there are some cards/gear that are more powerful than others, so it's easy just to use only the "good" cards/gear, skipping the rest). when that happens, there are large gaps in the frequency spectrum, meaning that there are lots of frequencies that are missed and that means that there are lots of stuff that's there, but it doesn't get picked up (like the difference between fluorescent lights vs sunlight: there are greens that can only be seen in sunlight -- cause the sunlight has a broader spectrum). so, since it's important to get the full spectrum, there's a whole lot of "bad" (or less than the best) that has to be experienced by earth (and its inhabitants).
	the reason for this, is that I believe the earth is the centre of the universe (meaning that it's attractive to more than 50% of the stuff out there), and I think the general trajectory that'll eventually happen, is that as earth takes in more and more vibrations from all around the universe, and finding a way to make all of that "bad" stuff that's out there in the universe, become wanted/attracted instead of repulsive, the general trend will be for all sorts of concepts all around the universe to begin consolidating into bigger and bigger concepts/stars -- and that consolidation will be sorta like the stuff we see as a "monopoly" -- where consolidation continues to happen all the way up until there are only two competing factions (one will be earth). the two factions will remain separated for as long as one can repel the attraction of earth -- but when earth is finally the most attractive (which is quite a ways off -- billions and billions of years from now), the whole universe will consolidate into one giant concept for a very brief moment causing an explosion of such magnitude that I cannot describe it -- and then out of that "manifestation" (which is just a bunch of concepts consolidating (coming together)) a "new" universe will be born.
there's nothing wrong with "bad" stuff. "bad" is only the label that we give it, because we're *symbolic* in our analysis, which means that we compare one thing to another, and depending on the aspects that we're able to identify (ie, we can only see the things that we're able to recognise/attract), we then analyse and determine which one is better than the other (relative to our perspective) -- but a frequency is just a spinning/orbiting/oscillating thing -- so depending on our perspective, we're going to see one thing and someone else will see another. there's nothing inherently wrong with any frequency at all, and so the goal is to find a way to achieve a perspective/relativity to that frequency which turns it from "bad" to "good" (or unwanted/wanted). that process of finding a way to look at anything and be either neutral (absorbing/seeing it, yet it has no notable effect) or "good" is the process I call "perception". it's essentially the ability to be a general machine that's capable of being in more and more diverse environments without any notable difficulty. some people are only able to operate in certain environments/conditions -- and others can operate in more. I (like earth) aim to be able to be OK in every situation that I'm put into -- and to not try and fight it, but instead try and find a way to feel good about it [ohhh, maybe then I should just go to oasis, even though it doesn't feel good to me -- not sure].
	people have often wondered why I have such a positive opinion/perspective about being homeless -- and to a large extent, the reason for this is my perception. sure, the lifestyle is a lot more difficult than normal house living (cause of cold and having to walk everywhere and stuff), but in general, I enjoyed it so much that I would easily do it again -- which means that I have a "positive" perception of it -- and it felt good to me -- which means that because we navigate time based on our emotions, because I could feel good about my homeless situation, I'll be going down timelines that reflect how I feel emotionally (timelines are just manifestations/consolidations of concepts into the world around us). the concepts that I attract, and the way that I perceive their frequency relative to myself, determines how the concepts that are coming to me (ie, the future) will "manifest".
therefore, anything feeling bad in the present or the future which is outside of my control, I tend to find a better or more neutral way to look at it. the reason for this is that if it's the present, it's already manifested and therefore there's nothing I can do about it (like the stupid saturnian-system pooping on everything that feels good to me). however, if I can find a way to feel better about it, the next time that a similar concept is coming in, my perception of it will require it to manifest differently. so, let's say that someone wants to punish me for something, and instead of that punishment feeling bad to me (the frequency responce they're desiring/attracting), I actually enjoy or am neutral to it, I'm not feeding them their emotional cookies anymore, and so they have to go find someone else to try and get that energy from. now, let's say they feel good/attractive to me now -- which means that they have to either get closer to me (and experience the energy I emit (which usually doesn't feel good to them)) or they have to repel me and keep their distance. if I feel neutral about them, there's no attraction or repulsion at all, and they feel inert or inconsequential. [I have more to say, but I don't feel like writing more right now. bye]

### 2024-12-16 20:00 - feeling bad about something we don't have control over (part 2)

hi again, I'm excited to write this one out because I have had a lot of thoughts/reactions to the previous entries. this morning I experienced that depression again (not my own), and I had a lot of thoughts on that -- but they'll wait for another day/time. I was surprised to see you talking to me and stuff today -- cause I figured that likely me writing here would make you feel a bit uncomfortable. I hope it doesn't -- though when you said that there were other things that were bothering you over the weekend (in the car), I imagined that it may have something to do with this. so, I'll keep things a bit short and try to not talk about so much personal stuff (though I'm not sure what is the problem) -- and actually I feel like it's a difficulty in communication. in the car tonight, I didn't feel like it was a good idea to ask you if you read these or not -- and honestly I don't much care if you have or have not -- cause writing you here has actually helped me to clear up a whole lot of my thoughts (the ones I had this morning and I'll write about soon enough). when we went to the ark, I felt a whole lot of negative emotion from you when mentioning abby (like your comments about how she has to wear pants/shorts under her dress cause she doesn't know how to sit like a lady) -- and even more when you were expressing your dissatisfaction about the place that you worked and writing on the wall your thoughts. oh, also when you were talking about abby understanding the words to the rap music pretty well (though I couldn't hear the words to the song in the car, I could imagine by the comments to justin that it must have had something to do with sex). oh, and also when you said you're just a robot now, not allowing yourself to react to others.
	after we came out of the ark, I was considering to make a comment about the negative emotion that I felt, but decided not to -- and then when you told the story about the marker, I was able to triangulate the emotions cause they felt pretty similar.
I didn't have enough time to really think about and try to figure out what I was feeling in the car, so I just sorta left it and resumed my normal superficial conversation (it takes me a bit to figure those sorts of things out because my brain doesn't work symbolically by imagining the implications, but instead by feeling the emotions relative to other emotions and then translating the synthesis of those emotions into thoughts and words (like I'm doing now) so it takes me a m6ment or two to process it all and start to get a sense). I'm sorry I'm so slow and stuff (and need some aloneish time) to process things, cause I just don't get a sense for that kind of stuff very well in real-time. I could have tried to ask a bunch of (non-standard/taboo) questions to try and figure it out -- but then again, when I'm around you, since I feel like you do, I'd be processing things in the same way that you do. it's good for me to separate myself a m6ment from the idea/emotion and give it a bit of time to develop. also, I really don't feel too comfortable asking those kinds of questions, because it's always caused problems in the past and turned close friendships into something that now feels like there are barriers between me and the other person, cause it feels like they have to watch their words/actions around me, so I don't peer through their facade and discover their weakness. my perceptive abilities have ruined so many friendships so many times before, I tend to stick to superficial conversation now (hence the reason why I was surprised that you came down to see me and didn't show too many signs of having extra barriers).
so anyway, I'll just keep my thoughts general here -- cause I think it's probably best. first, I'll give my comments on being a robot (this concept also combines with the story about how after your head injury, you didn't have any filters). I've been analysing you for a bit and I notice that you're pretty reflective in a lot of areas. being reflective is actually a pretty good thing. trying to become a robot and stifle the emotions that you feel -- will make you less reflective, but it doesn't really solve the problem. I'll use my own example here to explain. when someone makes m5 feel angry, the first thing to realise is that means that I'm *receptive* to their emotion -- and being receptive is good, because that means increased sensitivity. if I try and make myself into a robot and only respond to a person with very pre-programmed responses, I would quickly start ageing and would loose a lot of my charm. I'd start behaving a lot more like an older man that is guarded, protected, and unable to handle certain things (cause being a robot doesn't actually solve the problem). that symbolic layer (which is alot like a program -- where under certain conditions I behave one way, and other conditions another way) makes me static and that becomes the lens of the world that I see out of (ie, only the stuff that fits the conditions to the program). it also strongly restricts the way that I feel to only those set of conditions. it's possible to add more conditions expanding my behavioural spectrum, but it usually doesn't happen -- and instead what I do is I begin requiring others to conform more and more to the conditions that I *need* to have to be able to behave/feel the way I want to behave/feel. requring that of others quickly spirals out of control until I'm essentially stuck in my own symbolic system and am unable to escape.
	getting stuck in my own robot system has actually happened to me multiple times (and you can probably even see traces of it still remaining from the last time it happened (a few years ago)). because I'm so good at programming myself, getting stuck in robot mode has happened many tim5s (quick list: when I was 8-16 (decided to shut down my emotions), when I was 17-18 (decided to become superficial so that I can integrate with the world cause nobody liked the deep/insightful person I'd become after the brain haemorrhage), then in spain when I was 23 (trying to figure out girls), 24-26 (trying to figure out how to make the website I wanted), 28-30 (trying to recover from raquel), 33-36 (trying to get nosebook and all of that to be different), 38-40 (trying to accept that all of the stuff that I thought I wanted to do isn't going to happen, and just trying to settle into the a mundane life)). the most major one was the one that happened after I tried to shut my emotions down. I didn't just try to shut my emotions down once -- but multiple times -- and each time that I did, I became more and more depressed and upset with the world (I try so hard to conform to everyone else's expectations and be "normal" -- but no matter how hard I try, there's just no way that I can do the "right" thing and please everyone).
	each time that I thought that I'd built up a system that worked well for me (which only had to do with words/behaviour/action/conditions (symbolic stuff)), it'd work for a while -- and after a while the whole thing would start to have flaws. I'd try to patch up the flaws with more action (like buying the girlfriend/wife flowers to make up for cheating and lying to her -- that action may seemingly/temporarily "solve" the problem, it didn't actually change the disrespect I have for her (and she now has for me)). no amount of action can ever solve a failing symbolic system like that, and eventually my world comes crashing down, and I have to start over again. the reason is because it's the *emotion* that attracts, and that's what brings the whole thing down -- not the action.
		skipping forward a number of years, I later found out that if I can feel good (or not feel bad) about whatever it is that I'm doing, I never have serious consequences. in fact, it's been the case many times that (in spain where it's illegal) I'll be smoking weed in front of a cop without any issues (cause I'm not ashamed of it or trying to hide it), and then another guy will smoke and get into trouble. likewise, I've also noticed too that my saying one thing (which is taboo or not a good thing to say (cause I don't have a filter)) won't get me into trouble (because I didn't mean harm), but for others saying that same thing is really bad. then, when I have malicious intent (and even if it's true), saying taboo things not only gets me into trouble, I also get strong negative responces. inotherwords, not intending bad on anyone or intentionally trying to do harm, I can say pretty much whatever I want and not get into too much trouble for it (and when I do, I just mark it down that I should avoid that subject or some other fix to try and avoid causing problems for others). it's all about the *emotion* behind the action, not the action itself.
	so, after quite a few crashes of my robot/symbolic system (these are also called "boundaries" -- symbolic/conditional systems designed to avoid unwanted), I finally figured out that the only real effective thing that I can do is to find a way for the emotions that I feel (which I would previously try to fix/avoid (or react to) with action) to find a new form of perception which allows it to no longer bother me. that's really the *only* (IMO) way to actually be/have freedom -- because becoming a robot and just shutting down (resisting) others emotions, only attracts it further. I have to find a way to become neutral to (or even like) their pestering so I don't get those kinds of crashes over and over (I mention this because I gather that you've had a fair amount of crashes in your life as well).
crashes are inevitable, and are to be expected (just like with a website or any large computer/symbolic system). it's actually the only thing that can be guaranteed on earth -- so, *the only real solution is to have as quick of a recovery time as possible*. there are preventative measures though too, like *doing only things that feel good to me* -- because if I feel good about it (or at least not bad) then the emotion behind the action will always yield a good result (no matter what) -- even if it appears as if everything is lost and all the things desired/hoped for seem to no longer be accessible. I describe that process in terms of timelines -- because it's helpful for me to think of myself being on a timeline -- and if I choose actions that feel good to me, the beginning of that timeline feels good, and so no matter how much "bad" stuff happens along the way, it always works out just fine.
the opposite of that effect is also true, which is that any action/words experienced from someone else, *also have an emotion behind it*. therefore, if someone does something which is bothersome in some way, I find that an easy way to ease my perception of it, is to try and find the emotion behind their action. if someone is ignoring me, when I look at the action, it's easy to be upset or annoyed -- but let's say that I can feel that the emotion behind their action is that they feel some kind of shame or guilt for something -- well, then it's pretty easy for me to just let it go and not worry about their action. another example: let's say someone comes over and starts bothering me -- and I can sense that they just want/need attention -- well, then I can either cave in to their desire and give them their attention (and now it no longer bothers me), or I can set a boundary (which is symbolic) and say something like, "I really don't have time for this right now" -- but there is a small catch on that one, because the way that I feel my emotion when I say that will have everything to do with the result. if tell them I don't have time while feeling annoyance, I can be sure that I'm attracting more annoying things in the future (from them or others) -- or I can just reflect their own desire back to them when saying that and it'll feel to them that their desire (for attention) feels similar to my desire (to carry on doing what I'm doing). any other emotion (anger/frustration/etc) will only attract (put me on a timeline) where I experience more of that emotion. so, because I've found that it's usually easier to just go along with another person's desire and to feel good about my interaction with them, I tend to do that, because it then attracts more positive interactions with them.
I'm still kinda working on this concept (it's not finished at all) so this is a bit of a preview: just like fear and desire (or pain/pleasure) are the same thing viewed from opposite angles, so too are many of the emotions. I've noticed that recently I've been reflecting people a lot more -- but I tend to reflect more and more the positive aspects of the person back to them, than the negative. as an example, let's say that someone is trying to tell me what to do -- I can either dig my heels in and refuse to do it (resist them), or I can reflect them back to them and start telling them what to do, *or* I can capture the positive part of the emotion/intention, (which, let's say is their desire for m5 to be safe and and protected) and instead of respond in a way where I join them in their desire for m5 to go about doing what I want to do in a safe/protected way. inotherwords, if I align with their positive emotion/intent, then I can give them what they want, *and* also do things my way. [I think that's about good for now. I feel done writing. bye]

### 2024-12-16 23:56 - benefit of mistakes

it's possible that I may regret writing this,-- cause after I wrote the previous entry, though I was thinking about the thoughts from this morning (quite a few will be included in this one), the main topic that was on my mind was about how important it is to just let abby crash in her own way. what I mean by that is, -- for me at least, I really value my mistakes. so many things in my life have felt good to me, and I followed through on the action, only to find out that others were quite upset with me. many times, as well I lost a lot of money, or had other bad things happen to me as well. I wouldn't go back to change them, and they formed a huge part in learning about how to navigate life. it also taught me to really trust my emotions -- cause if the idea felt good, then it's just no problem at all. *if I can allow the transformation* (and that's a big "if"), then they always turn out better than before. so, in a sense, all of the "bad"/destroyed/failed things that happen (because of the way destructive interference works) only creates a higher frequency version of the same thing when it gets destroyed -- which then combines with other higher frequency concepts until it gets bigger and bigger and (if I'm actually able to allow the higher frequency concept to manifest -- which for most is the difficult part, because they're usually led to believe that they missed their opportunity), then an even better thing can actually manifest later on. the destruction of the thing that was about to manifest only *delayed* the manifestation by a little bit (the time that it takes me to discover and attract the higher frequency version into my life) and is never destroyed. energy *never* becomes a lower frequency, unless it's artificially relative to something else (like a star to a galaxy centre) -- so what happens is that things just constantly keep getting higher and higher frequency all the time (until wanting to create a newer lower frequency thing like the physical plane -- where everything is forced/limited into the lowest frequencies possible -- or for example, you want to incarnate into a human body, that's significantly lower frequency before).
what I'm trying to say here (ignoring the technical details I conjured to try and convince you of the truth to this concept) is that it's quite desirable to have "bad" things happen, and to make a lot of mistakes. this may surprise you: if you could see things the way that I do, you would be able to watch abby crash and make all kinds of mistakes, and it wouldn't bother you at all. you would know (like I do), that everyone figures it out eventually, and to try and protect or guide her, actually robs her of being able to come to her own conclusion of what she wants. lemme try again: when I look at myself from the outside-in, it's very easy for me to see how beneficial all of those mistakes were for me. each time that I tried to build up a structure/program for how my universe works and how it/I should behave, I was trying to pin life down and make it something that doesn't change -- or at least changes in a predictable way, where I could manage all of the things and keep everything just the way I wanted it, manifesting the things that I think I want, being completely a master creator of my reality. however, each time those crashes came, I had a realisation that I wasn't quite the master that I thought I was (normal for a guy with an ego like mine). so, I had to start over. each time, the things/opportunities that I thought I wanted went away, and I realised that the thing I thought I wanted, wasn't actually what I wanted.
what I mean by that is, let me take for example the idea that I eventually warmed up to the idea of a girlfriend/wife, and thinking that's what I wanted, I started to go after it. however, like I mentioned, I was trying to make something that has free-will (another human), essentially behave like a drug for me. I also wanted them to just do all of the stuff that I didn't feel myself capable of doing for me (in many areas I used to perceive myself as not capable). that manifestion didn't really work (and it wasn't sustainable), cause assuming that it did work out the way I wanted, and there was some kind of robo-woman that was capable of fulfilling everything I wanted, I perceived myself as extremely incapable in many areas (the ones that I would have been leaning on her to accomplish for me) -- and despite having the thing that I wanted (someone to do all of the stuff for me), my own insecurity and perceived inability would have continued to rise, probably hiding myself more and more behind her competency. my ego would have been shattered, and I'd constantly feel myself inferior and incapable in comparison to her. it's possible that I could have (had I not have learned LOA) begun to try and sabotage her in efforts to not feel so inferior, thereby destroying the my own sustinance, and then after having wrecked the relationship with her because of my own insecurities, I'd be out on my own again, and I'd have to finally face my own deficiencies. having the manifestation that I *thought I wanted* (ie, calculated-desire), I would have only delayed my demise and necessity to confront my own perceived shortcomings. so, (in my very humble and honest opinion) I'm glad to have crashed early and quickly. no matter how it went (getting what I wanted or having it all fall apart quickly), I had to actually address the real problem that I had, which was my attraction.
(this concept is a bit similar to the parenting concept) if I could actually swoop in to save someone from their attraction, and "teach" them how attraction works, they would have to actually want to learn it. it's impossible to teach someone something that they don't want to learn. wanting to learn something usually comes only after a few mistakes. my dad tried to teach me to not make the mistakes that he made, and mom has continually been scared to death of drugs (thinking that I'm the same as her), and yet I've encountered basically none of dad's mistakes, and I don't have a fear of drugs like mom does. there's no way that mom could have "taught" me to be as scared of drugs as she is,-- or for dad to have "taught" me to be as cautious as I should have been with business partners. I had to learn those things on my own -- *my own way*. a person that wants something (like I've always had a strong desire to do drugs) will always find a way to get what they want. it's been a thing of bitterness for mom, because no matter how much she tries to protect me and keep me away from drugs, they seemingly *find me*. I don't even really have to go out looking for them so much (she says, "people don't offer me drugs" -- "well, of course not, mom; you don't want to do them"). I honestly wish people would stop trying to protect me from doing drugs and just let me figure it out -- so while I began this entry talking about abby, I'm very much talking about myself. **I want to make my own mistakes and learn from them** (stop protecting me!).
whatever I attract is what I attract -- and I wish to pay the full consequences for whatever it is that I attract. I don't want other people constantly trying to guide and protect me. if I could just do it all the way that I want to do it, I would make all kinds of mistakes and figure it all out the hard way -- but again, nothing is ever lost when things are destroyed -- and they always come back in a higher frequency form. even if I lose my life, my life comes back to me in a higher frequency form (yes, I know that everyone still in lower frequency form still sees me as "dead", but I'm not at all dead -- just in an even higher frequency form than I was before I entered my body in the first place) so it's "all good" whatever happens.
with people like me, it's best to just watch us fail and instead of noticing all of the things that went wrong, just continually notice the constant improvements. I don't know if abby is like me in that regard (probably not), but there's no greater gift you can give her than to notice her improvements.
additionally, I'd also like to mention that even if someone could somehow swoop in and somehow "teach" her to begin attracting the things she doesn't know she wants (it usually takes a fair bit of sampling of unwanted to know what is actually wanted), that would rob you of the opportunity to be able to work on your perception. watching someone else fail (assuming that she'll go through a few crashes finding out that the thing she thought she wanted wasn't *actually* what she wanted) shouldn't be causing you negative emotion at all. it's called "radical acceptance". there's nothing you can do about what she wants and is attracting. trying to steer her away from her own attraction only makes it worse, and her to want (the thing you're trying to steer her away from) even more. the *only* person that can modify her attraction, is her. you'll get the opportunity to be able to see her get what she thought she wanted and then reevaluate (multiple times probably), and come to new determinations about what she wants. she's also just a robot in just the same way. she came out with programming, and that programming is going to inevitably fail. we all have this happen, and it's a very normal part of life. there's nothing you should try to protect her from. she'll figure out her own way, and the sooner you let her start figuring it out for herself, the faster she can make mistakes and recover from them.
I'm super toast, I'm sure... lol. I probably overstepped my boundaries here, but this is somewhat of a passionate topic for me, because I'm not really talking about abby at all. this message is to my mom, about me. I don't want any manifestations, and I want to carry on making mistakes and learning from them my own way. I really like that each time that something fails or something "bad" happens, it comes back at a higher frequency. keep the badness coming. I want to find a way to feel good in continually more difficult situations. I don't want to go the easy road.

#### 2024-12-17 13:36 - some context and some thoughts

last night, after the first entry, mom came and told me that I had to look for facilities today because she wants me out by the 27th of december. the other day I started to take over the process of doing all of the stuff that I need to do for myself and doing it my way -- but, as usual, she took it over from me (presumably because I wasn't doing it right), and so I just dropped it. I'm not going to fight her if she wants to do it. so, last night when she came and told me that now I have to return to doing it, I reacted to her (probably because she was pushing me and I assumed that if now she's telling me that I have to return back to doing it, she presumably messed it up, and I'm supposed to find my way on my own (again a reflection of her thinking I'm not asking the right questions and doing the things right)) and I tell her that the reason why the facility has failed was because I noticed that the minute she took over, it completely changed the energy. when I was doing it myself, it had my energy -- and the woman said I was all set and ready to go, and should just wait for a call (which I expected to arrive) -- yet mom says that now there are like 4-5 extra steps that weren't there before. I claim that the extra difficulty is a result of her putting her energy into it (I think of this like a timeline: the way that I felt about it when I was doing the thing, it felt to me that after I'd filled out the application, it was a done deal -- and that it was just waiting -- but then when mom puts her energy into it, now we move to another timeline where we have to experience her energy -- which will eventually bring me back to the way that I originally felt about it (ie, a slight detour -- which as I mentioned at the end of the above entry, is not all that big of a problem because it comes back as higher frequency anyway)). she heads off to bed, and I stay thinking about it, cause now I'm going to have to go back to doing all of the work, and in order to be able to do all of the work, now I have to leave only-attraction (because of her time constraint) and start to forge ahead a path that I think will get me toward what I want. I decide that the best way to do that is for me to cut her off from any more caregiving cause I don't want her energy getting mixed up in the manifestation again [which is contrary to the conclusion of the above -- as writing the above helped me to see that her putting her energy into my manifestation isn't actually all that big of a problem. if she wants to delay things further and make it higher frequency, that shouldn't be a problem; I just need to find a way to perceive things as not a problem (the current thing I struggle with the most)]
so, to kinda clear my mind and stuff I decide to take a shower and then go to bed. however, in the shower (with my new "I'm gonna make things happen my way" (2nd-ray) perspective) I started to get a whole bunch of cOncepts start to come to me. I noticed that the way that I felt about my mom trying to steer my life was kinda the same feeling as the one that I felt last night regarding abby. I have significant frustration (and I would guess you did as well with your mom) regarding her trying to steer me around her problems and toward things that she wants for herself/me.
	I really flourished in spain when I was away from her -- but that only lasted less than a year, because after the car accident, she stayed in spain with jaron -- and while she was a few hundred miles away from me in madrid, I remember being quite upset because now once again, now I have to start conforming to her expectations of me spending the holidays with her, coming to visit her, and things like that. each time I would go up, she would evaluate me and notice all of the things that were going wrong. in fact, I think that's all she noticed. I really couldn't (in any way) transmit the idea to her that I'm building a social network that's going to be able to help me to find other people that are like-minded to me (and so I won't have to hang out with dolts like zaryn). no matter how much enthusiasm I had, it just seemed to me like once she got into spain, now I was once again locked into her christian mindset of doing things God's way (which was usually pretty similar to whatever she thought was the right way). I'd already had a brain haemorrhage trying to reconcile the incompatibilities between God and technology -- so I kinda just kept away from her and her house (which was very sad for her because she wanted me to visit with her and spend time with her instead of working on my creations (the same difficulty that I had with raquel and others)). I really couldn't figure out how to exactly go the way that I wanted to go without going against whatever mom wanted me to do -- so (like with raquel) it was a no-win situation: if I did what she wanted, I just sat around and didn't really create anything meaningful -- or I went against her energy and tried to create what I wanted to create. the difficulty is, that what I create, is a reflection of the energy that I'm in -- so when around zaryn and the homies, what I create (tuenti - the network were guys all around spain were able to hook up for the first time) is a reflection of them -- and when I'm around dani, the way that I create reflects him -- same for mom, and same for everyone else. the problem is, that mom's energy isn't very socially flowing -- and so the things that I worked on for tuenti (namely the photo uploader queue) tended to reflect her energy, and so they were lots of hard work with a whole lot of trial and error -- where after some period of time some small bug would cause the system to fail spectacularly (which is what happened -- and poor joax, he probably got blamed for it, but that was definitely mom's energy -- though joax shared a lot of that same energy too).
anyway, I wanted to express my frustration for taking on the energy of the guidance that I receive in a bit of an ironic way, so I started to get a bunch of ideas together where I would go about *telling you what to do* (cause remember I'm now in the mood of figuring it out my own way because of the dissatisfaction of my mother with me) -- which I can easily see that you probably can comiserate with as a child/teen with your mother and likely abby will be doing as well in the future.
	the concept of me (and other reflectors, which most kids are) taking on the energy of the guiding force (your stories about abby suggest that she's quite a good reflector of your energy/annoyance back to you) goes like this: the if the guidance/steering I receive comes from zaryn/marcos/augusto, the result will reflect zaryn/marcos/augusto and will contain the results that would occur as if they were the executor of the operation -- inotherwords, if my guiding force (boss/supervisor/parent) feels very insecure or fearful, then as I'm approaching the event/task that they've given me guidance on, I'll feel similar to how they do (if I don't have much/any experience of my own). as an example, if you tell abby something, though you may be telling her the way to do something to protect her from something, if she has little experience of the thing on her own, she'll feel like you do about the same subject and often times that causes her to attract the unwanted situation even worse (usually unable to comply with the symbolic procedure *you told her to perform to avoid the unwanted*), and so feeling similar to you, it's more likely she'll have the same results that you did (and then say to herself, "mom was right; I *should* have performed the operation she told me to perform in that situation") -- all the while completely unaware to the fact that it was *how she felt about the thing* that caused her to attract it in the first place. you can't teach a kid how to feel, because they don't have a symbolic system developed enough to be able to manipulate their emotions yet. a kid learns how to feel about a situation from those around them. ie, if abby likes how justin feels about a situation, she'll pick up that feeling and use it -- or jeremiah, or whatever. by default, she'll feel like you do in the situation (this is why it's so freeing to a woman when her mother dies) -- and so when you change your perception (how you feel about a situation), not only do you provide a different default mode for her, but you also provide her a conceptual example (reflective/absorbative people and kids just automatically pick up the concept of what it feels like to be around the other person -- and it's not definitive, but more like "I like the confidence that I feel when I'm around kenny" (for example) and that sticks with her). I can remember how hundreds of people feel, and there have been many many times that even with only a short interaction with someone (like a really rich guy in a disco), I managed to capture a portion of a person's feel (which is just the concept of their perception -- the conceptual/emotional lens through which we perceive the world), and then been able to modify it and gain that feeling/perception for myself (after the universe "tests" me to ensure and reinforce that I actually see things in that new way).
	kids (and people like me) pick up all kinds of these essences from others all around them -- and then we have to find a way to turn them into reality by finding a behaviour that reflects that feeling. for kids, the requirement to find a symbolic behaviour pattern which reflects their perception happens around puberty -- and is the leading cause of depression, because for example, I had captured a lot of different forms of perception (most notably from tesla when I read his autobiography at ~9yo) and the problem was when puberty hit, the forms of perception that I'd captured and wanted to implement, I couldn't find a way to begin behaving in a way which would reflect that. as an example, let's say (easier to see if I'm a girl) I saw some supermodel or really pretty princess that seemingly had the material wealth or perfect guy that I would want to have -- but let's say I'm kinda fat and I don't really think very highly of myself -- and there just isn't any super duper princes out there that I can go after -- just a bunch of nerdy/resistant boys which look nothing like the guy that supermodel/princess has, not only does it look like I have no option of getting it -- then there's also the difficulty that (because all I can see is appearance and action and what I see is true), it seems like I need to start acting like that supermodel/princess in order to be able to get what I want. not always is it possible for a boy/girl to start acting/behaving like they have a lot of money or the conditions that their original captured essence has -- so many kids give up, thinking that all is lost (that's the source of depression) -- but in fact, the opposite of the situation is true: if the kid would learn to feel like the essence that they captured, the symbolic stuff (the material clothes/wealth/etc and the aura/presence that captured them in the first place) would come naturally. the way they feel is what attracts the reality, not the behaviour (which often times parents/others are resistant to because it looks to them like the kid is "not living reality"). parents/others can shun and try to maniulate behaviour, but they can't touch the way that a person feels and carries theirself (unless the guidance tries to guide the kid to have the same fear/emotions/excitement to the situation/thing as the parent has). the struggle to want to have the feelings of like those original inspirations (and they don't have to be real people either -- cause I had G.I.Joes and fictitious characters that I liked their feel/presence/perception as a kid, and adapted that)
		actually, there's an interesting story around this: the other day I was at friendly harbor and they turned on the movie "zoolander" -- a movie I hadn't seen probably since then, and I had all kinds of flashbacks, because I remembered that after after I got out of the hospital, I was lacking personality. sure, I'd rebuilt myself to be able to be a programmer cause I figured that was the best way that I could make the technical revolution that I could feel from	the essence that I captured from tesla and liked so much. that was also the perception that directly conflicted with church and a lot of others ideas about what technology should be used for (even the book mom read me in the hospital, "left behind" was about how the anti-christ used technology to get people into his network and manipulate them (lol)). I wanted to use technology for "good" -- to create the things that I thought could really benefit me, earth, and its inhabitants. (I claim) that incongruence of technology and God is what caused the haemorrhage in the first place -- so now being able to start over, I was going to build a new personality for myself -- one that I liked. I took a lot of inspiration from a lot of different places, but I was surprised when I watched the movie the other day how well I'd captured the essence of derek and hansel (and to some extent mugatu). on one side I had this really free-flowing guy that likes to do drugs and hang out with celebs -- and he's just givin it his best (even if he has no idea what he's doing) -- and then on the other side, there's this other guy that's pretty affeminate that's trying to get the approval of his father, but can never get it. he does things to try and please other people and get their approval, all the while he's clearly not at all "normal", he's still trying to be "normal" and so he can be accepted -- he's completely clueless that it's his massive ego and high opinion of himself (he's really really really really good looking) that make him not-normal because nobody else has that, so it's a constant turn-offs for others. in addition to derek and hansel (actor "slash" model), I also captured the essence of a number of a adam sandler movie characters. I was genuininely surprised at how amazing I'd actually shaped my constructed/new personality to be in their conceptual image.
	kids capture the personality of an idol/hero all of the time -- and I think it's quite a good thing. it's not necessary to be a kid or a person with a brain haemorrhage and memory loss to do that. it can be done at *any time* -- but it's not usually done because of people's expectations for us. it's other's expectations (most notably of the parents/guidance that a person has) which locks us in to having the personality/concept of us that they think we are. it's hard to break out of someone else's concept of me -- though, for example, if you move to a new town/city or enter into a cult or something like that (maybe even change your name), a person can start over -- and the amount that they can change will directly depend on how strong the concept of the person those that are close to them have. we hold each other all the time into the concept of them that we think they are, making it difficult to change our personality (ie, the way our concept of ourself interfaces with the outside world) really easily.
in a situation where a child/person is constantly being a reflection of the guidance that they're under, if the child/person wants to be something else, they are then forced to build up a symbolic personality to replace/protect the conceptual/attractive one, and start to engage life through that personality (ie, figure it out their own way) -- and so we enter into assertive/emitter mode (like I did last night) -- and then calculating the thing that we think we want/need to get out from under our guidance and/or get what we want, we then push forward on the plan, regardless of the parent's feelings on the matter. *we must find a way to get what's wanted* (which is usually incompatible with mom/parent's guidance). so, I did just that and turned it into text: I formulated a whole bunch of things that I would tell you to do *which are correct* (assuming the child is attempting to find their way or get around the guidance) and make it as extreme as possible (though, it is a good idea to just let others figure things out for theirselves) -- and I also purposefully left out the entire subject of emotions and timelines too, because I knew that if I did, then without a perceived guidance system (the ability to go a different way) the way I presented it, I would make it sound like we're all doomed to this eternal loop of watching others crash and burn (cause trying to protect/guide away from what their attracting only makes it worse) -- and so I made it sound like the only solution is to just let whatever the person attracts have its way, try out that new attracted structure for a bit, and wait for the next crash -- which is kinda true but not totally because if she could follow her emotions over others guidance, things would work out fine and her symbolic structure (and what it attracts) will evolve over time, just like how I repeatedly figured out that what I *thought* I wanted wasn't what I really wanted.
	there's actually something to say about this: as I've repeated this crash and recalculate my desires loop over and over again, each time that it's happened, I've managed to attract something that did fit with what what I thought I wanted (even though, as I mentioned, sometimes there was quite an age gap) -- each time it happened, I came to the realisation that the thing that I thought I wanted (outside of myself) wasn't actually what I *really* wanted. if I had've been able to get what I wanted, I wouldn't have had to face a lot of my shortcomings, and the things that they attracted. for some people, it may be fine for them to see theirself as a person with shortcomings and to be able to hide them behind a manifestation like that -- but for me, that's actually quite detestable. it's likely my ego talking here, but I want to *actually be* the person that I believe myself to be. my ego isn't constructed on shaky foundations -- and the reason why I have such a high opinion of myself is that I actually have all of the qualities that I perceive myself to have (many others don't have that) -- and so therefore, because I rely so much on actually being the person that I think I am, my own desire requires me to actually be the thing that I want (since anything wanted is just a feeling-reality, I want a feeling -- so I can either have conditions produce that feeling for me, or I can produce the feeling for myself, not needing the conditions to get the feeling -- which means that having that feeling, I'm attracting that feeling-reality all the tim5; my world now reflects that feeling -- so now it's how I feel inside affecting/attracting outside conditions, instead of the conditions outside affecting how I feel inside). I prefer to be the origin and centre of my creation (ie, everything outside more and more perfectly reflects how I feel inside), so (especially for someone like me), a manifestation isn't really what I want, so long as it's a singular manifestation. I only want to live inside of "normal" reality, where everything is a reflection of my perception.
additionally, I skipped over the part that I'm learning now, which is that if she can feel good about whatever she's attracting and manifesting, and also feel good/neutral about her outside guidance (as in, not fighting against mom -- like I'm trying to learn/do), then everything will work out fine. I skipped it because it's still a thing that I'm learning myself and I prefer to only present the things that I'm actively an example of. 
lastly, I purposefully went for a somewhat shocking/ironic presentation of the concept, because there's no other way that I could present the idea otherwise. I really mean all the stuff I wrote above, but keep in mind that I wrote it (purposefully) from a non-receptive/emitter perspective. [I do think I was reflecting you a bit -- cause the feeling I had resonated with your marker story, and it seems plausible to me that you would have said a lot of those same things perhaps to your mom as well -- dunno, just an idea -- anyway, I'm really happy with how the writing turned out. I really surprised myself there.]

### 2024-12-18 23:02 - I feel like I'm about to throw you under the bus

this concept is somewhat difficult to translate because it has a lot of components to it which likely need to be explained (I'll assume you don't have any prior knowledge of the concepts building up throughout my writing up till now).
it starts like this: I really wish that I could communicate better with you (and understand that communication is relational, and so therefore 2nd-ray -- like a star) -- however, I don't *really* want to find a way to communicate better with you because of two reasons: 1. if I were able to communicate to you in a reasonable way the concepts that I can perceive and things, *it would dramatically increase your attraction of those things* -- which would be very very unwanted for you -- and 2. *I really want to remain selfish and self-centered* (lst-ray, which I am). if I start to meddle with you relationally, I throw myself off because I start to orbit you and I'm no longer the centre, cause now I'm relative to you. not wanting to lose my centre status (until I've transformed into a concept projecting down into physical (ie, spiritual being having a physical experience -- instead of a physical being having a spiritual/sexual experience)), -- is also the same reason why I don't want to have sex -- because by involving myself with someone else, I now am intimately tied to their energy -- and like a binary star, we would be in tight orbit with each other. sex is perfectly fine *once I'm the centre*, because then all the relationships are all relative to me (like a galaxy centre) which just means that my attraction (density/mass) is so large, even if I relate to someone or interact with them, I'm not affected by them. I obviously have quite a ways to go -- because I'm still pretty affected by others. along the way, it'll appear like I'm more and more caloused and not caring about what happens to other stars (even if it's absolutely terrible) -- like a true galaxy centre.
going back to the first reason: I've had the experience many times where I tell someone what I see/perceive, and since they're incapable of changing the way they feel about the subject, their attraction of the unwanted thing happens even faster and faster and then finally manifests. to give a very concrete example of that, back when marcos and I would talk about the difficulty of andrea taking interest in me, I presented to him the idea various times about how he *should* let her have her way and just let her get what she wants -- because she's gonna get what she wants, no matter how much he tries to steer her otherwise (you see, back then, I shoulded on a lot of people a lot more than I do now -- yet the only time I did that to you so far was when I talked about [the benefits of mistakes](#2024-12-16-2356---benefit-of-mistakes) -- and in that, I shoulded on you there after getting into 2nd-ray mode because mom said I need to start figuring out my own way and doing it -- as a contrast to [the previous entry](#2024-12-16-2000---feeling-bad-about-something-we-dont-have-control-over-part-2) where I was not trying to navigate by emitting, but instead by attracting what I want by feeling better about it). I know now it was a mistake on my part to have shoulded on him -- and it eventually did turn out just like I imagined -- to which I made another grave mistake -- which was allowing the increase of his attraction of unwanted and her getting what she wanted *to cause me to feel bad* (after all, *she did get what she wanted* and the manifestation reflected how she felt (pushing/rebeling against her guidance), so there's really no problem at all). as a centre, there's just nothing I can do about anyone else. I don't have any influence on them, what they do, their orbits,-- and what they attract is their attraction, not mine. I've since learned that the things that others attract (unwanted or wanted), don't need to affect me. my worst enemy (though I'm not sure who that would be) could have the most beautiful woman/girls, have all the money, and even have complete control over my body,-- and still my reaction is either neutral or genuinely be happy for them (which is already true the present) -- cause *that's their manifestation, not mine* (which will always turn out to be a reflection of how they feel) -- and that response is going to be the same way that I respond to your manifestations (unwanted or wanted). if your manifestations have an affect on me, then I'm being moved by something else other than my own attraction. therefore, as I become more and more of a centre, I'll be moved less and less, caring less and less about what happens to others. so, in that sense, as we're around each other more and more (and if we find a way to communicate better), I'm definitely going to "throw you under the bus" (sorry about that ahead of time).
one part of my really doesn't want to be around you more and more, because I can already start to see your life (cause of what you attract (ie, the feelings you emit)) is starting to speed up and attraction is increasing. I really wish to advise you to steer clear of me, unitil you are able to feel the way you want to feel, because the way that you feel about things is going to manifest quicker and quicker. *you will have the things that you fear manifest* -- and there's nothing that I/you can do about it -- which will be kinda nice for you because then you're going to get a good opportunity to be able to feel the way that you want to feel even though the situation isn't what you wanted it to be (again, I tried to tell this to marcos after andrea went her own way, but I was not experienced enough in doing that I was really advising him to do something I hadn't accomplished myself -- so it was (pretty likely) hilarious to outsiders, watching me tell him to do something I was clearly not very good at myself ("do as I say, not as I do", right?)). so let's say that we continue hanging out, attraction increases and then when your fears manifest and everything falls apart, and let's say you're still able to feel good about all of the destruction and wreckage, unfulfilled expectations and failed hope -- then you're starting to get it -- and I'll feel like my influence was beneficial to you -- and also I'll be really proud of you too, so it's alright if it all falls apart :) "not my problem" and "not my manifestation" are key ingredients there, and the foundation for your own budding self-centredness (yay!). [I'll try and communicate this idea you you in a somewhat straight-forward manner, because I really feel like if I continue to come to friendly harbor, things are going to just keep getting worse. I really don't have any problem just going another way and finding another thing to do. I'm pretty versatile and stuff -- and I really hate watching people I actually like go through a terrible time because they're not used to navigating at high speeds. I really don't know how to present the idea. as I keep thinking about it, the more I think about it, I may have to just do the oasis thing, and just kinda distance myself a bit from pueblo. as much as I think I want to be around and in walking distance, perhaps this is my time (like jesus and moses did) to retreat to the desert for a while and expand my mind a bit out there, visiting a little less often and stuff -- then, once I'm even more stable/attractive than I am now (more centred), that's prebably the time to start being social again. I'm just not sure I want to keep increasing social interaction while I'm still pretty wobbly and not-centred.]

### 2024-12-20 00:33 - concept of reality

tonight's chat over txt msg provided a great conversation. one of the subjects that I wanted to expound on, was the subject of how the concept that we have of the other person influences the way that reality manifests (ie, the timeline that we're on to prove that concept as true) -- which was pretty funny because right as soon as I was about to launch off into trying to explain (the part I'm going to write in the next paragraph), aaron came in and (IMO) proved a cOncept -- and that then your comment about that sorta deflated the thing that I was going to write.
	aaron's actions could be seen as intentional to try and prevent me from asserting my beliefs on you or not -- but just like dropping the phone, it's not intentional -- just that things play out to prove our concepts of reality -- which one of them that I have is that I've often noticed that when I go to try and explain my understanding of attraction and stuff, is that often times someone will cut me off, or an event will occur (like someone dropping something or making a mess) which will derail the conversation. I don't know if it's intentional or not (cause it appears often to me there are efforts to keep my perspective of reality largely hidden from the general public (probably because it'd be pretty awful for those that want to control everything if more people than just myself knew about how timelines are attracted based on one's concepts)).
so, I'd like to try and put this concept into text, for two reasons: 1. for	those that are interested in blocking these concepts from others (nosebook), they can get a good resonance with them and do their best to both block me from returning to the concept causing further evolution of the concept, and also to ensure that others aren't able to get to the concept either -- forcing them to learn it through experience, instead of through being "taught" by me; and 2. I want to try and improve my delivery of the concept as well. imagine that tomorrow or some time in the future you ask me about navigating/attracting/manifesting realities -- and I want to talk about how our concepts of everything in reality do that, I'll have done a few drafts of the idea first (every single time that I write the same concept, I improve upon its delivery, being able to convey the same thing more succinctly and clearly -- which is why I repeat myself so much -- mostly for my sake of being able to say the thing easier -- cause I'm kindof an overexplainer).
so here's the first draft: if my concept of someone is that they are constantly trying to destroy my efforts (for example, like the concept I have of nosebook), then that means that when when we interact, there's a significantly stronger probability that they will manifest my concept of them as true/right. the origin of this manifestation takes place in the "neo cortex" -- the part of the brain that is unique to humans, which is responsible for directing us through time. we analyse things in our brain, and unlike other mammals and reptiles, humans come to the conclusion that we're "right" about our analysis. that analysis is cOceptual, and attractive -- meaning that the things that we focus on and observe are attracted so that that we're proven "right" about our conclusions. attracting a reality which proves our concept of reality as right, is a circular/infinite feedback loop (kinda like sticking a microphone in front of the speaker), and causes us to manifest our expectations of reality more and more rapidly.
each time that we manifest our expectation of reality as correct, if the manifestation is unwanted, it produces a lot of negative emotion cause the manifestation impacts our perception of reality (the dark/attractive star in the centre of the head) and causes a whole lot of our concept of reality to shatter and be destroyed. our brain is quite resiliant though, and so our neuronal system can rebuild our perception to be nearly the same way that it was before by reinterpretting the concepts of our experience in nearly the same way that we had previously, resulting in nearly identical perception as previous to the crash from the unwanted manifestation. the bigger the crash, the more of our perception is shattered, and the more that needs to be rebuilt. each rebuild is never identical to the previous (cause it includes the concepts that were produced from the experience that produced the crash). therefore, no matter how hard we try to rebuild our perception in the same exact way (for example, how a religious text says reality operates), each rebuild is always going to be slightly different than the previous build -- meaning that it attracts slightly differently.
all concepts which are similar merge with each other and get bigger -- so for example, if one of my conclusions about reality is that "all women are cunts" and my symbolic defense structure for it is to keep my distance from them -- the next time I get another unwanted manifestation with a cuntish woman, a large chunk of my perception will be impacted because my concept that "all women are cunts" directly attracts concepts which resonate with that into my experience and then the manifestation (the impact/collision/consolidation of my concepts of reality and the concepts behind whatever their actions were that proved my perception right) will destroy and reinforce a lot of my perception (my perception of the resulting concepts from the manifestation (the concepts produced from my expectation) which align with my perception (what she did was cuntish and unwanted) will merge with the ones that they resonate with (all my existing percepion of how big of cunts they are), and the ones that don't align (ie, "I want to go through my day in peace" or "this is a really peaceful place to be") will be completely obliterated), I'll say to myself, "see just what I thought -- those bitches show up, and so obviously that's what happen" and that analysis/conclusion causes me to rebuild my perception in a way which just strengthens my conclusions. that carries on for ever and ever until it gets so bad that I finally decide that I need to setup even better boundaries ("I need to maintain even more distance") and I hope those defenses will be able to prevent my attraction/perception from destroying another conflicting part of my perception. *I MUST be right about what I believe!* (but I want it to be different) -- so I keep trying to find a way to build better and better systems to prevent the unwanted things that I believe from manifesting.
obviously because I'm both attracting my desirable and undesirable concepts of reality (which are incompatible) into the same reality, continues to produce endless conflict, until eventually I arrive to a set of conclusions/perceptions which produces a reality which no longer has unwanted (nirvana). inotherwords, as long as unwanted is present in a manifestation, the unwanted concepts of that manifestation will amplify my perceptions which produce unwanted -- thereby attracting more unwanted manifestations. that continues to speed up until our attraction of unwanted is so strong that the body cannot take anymore, and we die.
[I need to think about a better way to translate the other half/direction/angle of this concept, cause it's not ready for primetime yet. I don't know how to explain how perceived time is just the rate in which we prove our concepts as right. good enoough for now though.]

### 2024-12-21 10:40 - thoughts about the future

yeah, it's weird that I noted to you that you sent me the message last night at 22:40, and I commented noticing that "the tick" says l0-40, instead of 10-4. then, I go to write about my difficulties and thoughts (before I take adderall) -- and strangely enough, it's 10:40 again... anyway...
the one thing that really stood out to me in our interaction last night, is that you mentioned "suspicious 0bservers" -- and I said "I know ben -- not personally, but I know him for a while". I've been watching that channel since 2011 when I lived in berlin, and it's sorta strange because I would often times watch the morning news (back then, it was n MIN space news) -- and I really enjoyed starting to correlate the strange things that I would feel in my body to solar and geomagnetic events. like I mentioned, he rarely (if ever) showed the magnetometer in the news, but would constantly say that "earth's magnetic sheield is failing/dropping" -- and show a graphic of it dropping over the last few years, claiming that was evidence that earth's poles were about to flip. I strongly disagree that earth's magnetic field is getting weaker, and think that the intensification of the magnetic field in recent years is actually evidence of even greater emotional intensity that's felt on the planet (which is why emotions are so much higher compared to say the 1980's). the other thing that I thought was interesting is that he changed his position on the poles flipping as well, claiming instead that the earth will instead turn on it's side (sorta like uranus). I feel that's more likely to happen, but it won't be a point out in the indian ocean, but more likely one of the poles that points toward the sun (I believe this was also the configuration during the "atlantian" times as well -- and even shakespere has all kinds of references to the moon becoming our new "sun" (in TOTS, petrucio tells kate that if he says the moon is the sun, then so it shall be)).
anyway, the reason why I stopped watching the news is because of his disaster focused approach to space news (and IMO blatant lies). btw, just as a side thing: I feel it's very likely that he's funded by the government because last time I looked (or at least when I was paying attention to it), his graphics were hosted on AWS (amazon web services) -- which is *the most expensive bandwidth*. their compute prices (for distributing calculations over many machines) are reasonably priced, so most people use that and host their stuff elsewhere. there are many other services that offer considerably better bandwidth prices, that it's kinda strange that amazon is selling so much stuff. well, their main customer is the government, and though most people don't want to pay those prices, the government seems to be just fine paying such high prices for bandwidth. I would bet there's a hidden contract/agreement in there somewhere, and the various web services that are offered to the public are all enormous bandwidth hogs. I dunno for sure, but I find it somewhat unlikely that he's paying for that bandwidth with YT ad revenue. in any case, his consistent narrative also suggests to me that he's got to have some kind of sponsor/motivator of some kind.
anyway, I don't feel like there's going to be a disaster at all -- yet you claimed pretty emphatically that the next one would be one where there's no more electricity anymore. personally, I refuse to live in such a society -- and prefer to die. no thank you. however, I started to think about it in reference to what happened in the americas after the time of jesus, and how I think many of these ancient civilisations seemingly appear out of nowhere (incas, aztecs, aryans, jews/hyxos, etc). that's a difficult concept to explain in just a paragraph or two, so I'll skip it for now. the essential ingredient that I'm wanting to point out is that these people's seem to go through a tremendous disaster (usually something solar (like a "mininova"), which causes lots of flooding because when lots of hydrogen hits earth's atmosphere, the friction allows the hydrogen to combine with earth's oxygen making water; lots of it), and then after such a disaster these newcomers arrive to earth (my theory is that they were previously on a moon or planet farther out in the solar system), and with their new technology, start to take over and wreck havoc on the inhabitants of earth (which are usually "indigenous" tribes and things).
when these newcomers come to earth, the majority of them are "emitters" -- meaning, people that need something outside of them to be different in order to feel good. I mentioned yesterday that I thought that having aaron around was good for you because it gives you good practise to be able to find a way to feel good *without needing him to change* (cause he's not going to change anyway) -- and you then positively identified yourself as an emitter by saying that you absolutely cannot find a way to do that, and *need* him to leave in order for you to feel better (just like mom needs me to leave so she can feel good - lol). so, I started to think about it, and perhaps this time around, the emitters won't be dudes that need to grow their empire, but women instead that need things to be just a certain way. nice. I'm glad that it'll work out for you, and you get a chance to make earth the way that you want it. happy disastering :)
I personally don't really care much for such a disaster -- however, there's another key ingredient here, which is that many of these disasters (including the atlantian crash and the appearance of shakespere) happen in an astral system (like a solar system), and then the contents of that system drop down into physical and take on real material form. the trigger for it is usually some kind of heightened solar activity -- and one of my theories on it, is that as different stars in the galaxy go supernova, the inhabitants that survive that disaster out there are the ones that make it into earth's physical system -- though I can't be certain of it, it's the most plausible explanation.
the thing is, mental activity and depth of perception is greatly increased the farther away from earth that you get (ie, when on pluto because of the higher speeds, I'll be able to think and reason about things much more clearly -- kinda like when using aphetamines, cognative function is increased because of the increase in speed). so, when they make it down to earth, everyone that arrives (because they make it to the slowest speed), is going to be significantly more stupid -- and the good feeling energy of the higher speeds (like when on meth) also goes away as well, so not only when they arrive do they become more stupid, they also feel worse. this immediately causes dissention and division amongst the arrivers (most notably the aryans), which causes lots of in-fighting and competition for resources. they're no longer in the lofty ideal state of mind/emotion that the astral system provided previously, and have to now take on their reality, *realistically*. obviously, it's a lot more difficult and a lot of stuff fails -- however, because these guys always come in with a whole bunch of documents and technology, they're able to use their technology and religion to be able to get a *significant* edge on the present inhabitants of earth and conquer them both mentally and physically. this will almost certainly be the case for you/us as well, as the technology that I'm figuring out is going to be signifcantly better.
I don't really want to go to earth yet and become stupid ken, a bimbo reflection of my owners -- not yet anyway. I want to keep writing and figuring out how concepts work and stuff. I don't even really want to go to earth either -- but it's kinda inevitable, because I'll keep lowering resistance till eventually someone is finally so attractive that I'm just unable to say no to them -- and we'll have sex, and then I become a reflection of them -- and then say goodbye to everything I *know* and all of the concepts that I've acquired up till now; I'm now like them, and kenny is gone. all of the stuff that I've been figuring out about emotions and all of the stuff that I've understood about "law of attraction" -- gone. I'll become a reflection of the person that I'm with, attempting to make my reality feel good in a similar manner that they do. I prefer to actually figure it out and get in a lot more practice, than to become a retard overnight -- so as far as I'm concerned, I've been avoiding ben's disaster narrative for a while. when I feel ready, I suppose it's OK -- but I really have other things I'd prefer to do with my time than just be a retard on earth with a bunch of women that need things to be different so that they can feel good. they'll be there and all of those things that they thought were the problem from before (aaron, me, etc) will be gone, and so it'll appear like I'm the problem cause I'm a reflection of them. meh, I don't really want to do that. dbt says I should use my avoidance skill on that one :)
ironically, you suggested last night that you think it'd be perhaps helpful if I could live with you and help pay half of the rent (though, I'm sure you could probably also take over the "caregiver" thing too) -- which would almost certainly turn into a disaster, because I'd inevitably become a reflection of you. [brb, I want to take a break for a bit]

#### 2024-12-22 22:30 - too good

last night I mentioned that I don't like to go for any manifestaion that is terribly good (or bad feeling), because in the case of it being really good feeling, the "consequence" of that manifestation is that something always happens that causes something difficult to appear. I do believe that I've gotten to a spot in my life now where I don't really experience self-inflicted negative emotion anymore (ie, the only time I experience negative emotion is when I'm a reflection of someone -- and that's only because I *choose* to experience negative emotion), so if something that felt really good happenned to me, I'm fairly certain that others around me would experience all kinds of difficulty and negative emotion because of faulty beliefs and ignorance that the way a thought feels, is the thought's alignment with the person's trajectory, where good-feeling thought means good-feeling timeline, and bad-feeling thought means bad-feeling tim5line. I'm pretty secure in my ability to navigate, and I feel like I'd probably be OK, but it would cause for a pretty difficult ride, simply because the good-feeling generated by the manifestation (easy references here are drugs and sex) can completely overshadow the (much smaller) bad-feeling that is telling me that something isn't a good idea to carry through with. inotherwords, with good-feeling at max volume, it's hard to hear the subtle indicators that something isn't quite right (coke is a tremendously great example of this effect). it's likely that I'll not be the only person experiencing this effect too, as it seems that the way that I feel seems to be somewhat contageous (or maybe is broadcasted out or something -- not sure), so what that means to me is that a larger number of people will be artificially feeling better than they normally would,-- making a crash significantly more liable to happen. though it is a bit more dramatic to navigate like that, I feel like it's a bit "irresponsible" for me to accelerate everyone and just hope that they figure it out.
	the very real effect of me speeding up reality and everyone around me is precisely the reason why I've stopped star-watching. I could clearly see that the speed increase that occurred during that time of 2016-2020 was quite notable, and seemed to affect nearly all aspects of society. I remember back then, how even watching a youtube video on any speed less than 1.5x felt super slow. everything was going too fast, and I just didn't feel like that was a good way to go about doing things. if I want to speed things up, I'll go back to star-watching again.
however, I'm not really into going fast anymore, and have since begun to really enjoy the "middle path" -- which is not trying to go in a direction that feels especially bad or good -- just kinda being neutral and pretty chill about all things. my goal is to find ways to get the thing without needing to have a manifestation -- preferring as few large manifestations as possible. I like to think of instead as my day being composed of tons and tons of relatively insignificant manifestations, instead of swinging between the extremes. *I prefer to feel pretty good all day long, rather than swinging from extreme good/pleasure to extreme bad/destruction*. it's just a lot easier and nicer (for me and everyone else) when things are going slow. there's tons of time to go fast in the future, but now isn't the time. I have many plans to build systems which will allow me to go fast -- but it's not yet possible to make them right now, so instead of trying to make those things happen, I just want to attract/wait for them.
	we also talked yesterday about how it's common for me to get a really good idea, and let's say that it's a multi-day idea (something big like a website, business, or romantic partner) -- then it's usually the case that after sleeping on the idea, I tend to wake up the next morning and the idea either doesn't feel good to me, or I just don't care about it anymore. I attribute this effect to nosebook's efforts to rearrange the concepts in my head while I sleep, to kinda reduce the attraction/good-feeling of those ideas. it could be that, or it could be just that the majority of those ideas would be "too good", and would cause me to be 2nd-ray (having a defined emission/absorbtion spectrum) instead of 1st-ray which is all the frequencies.
the thing is, that earth (and myself) are not interested in being attractive to only a specific set of frequencies -- but instead to being receptive to all frequencies. the previous way of doing things (before myself) is that earth just brute-forces all frequencies -- and so to give you an idea what I mean, let's just assume that there are a finite set of true/false attributes: nice, good-looking, athletic, douchebag, caring -- and so with those 5 attributes, we can construct 2^5 (16) different people. of the 16 different people, there will be exactly 1 best (having all of the good attributes), 1 worst (having all of the worst), and 14 others (having a combination of the attributes). with that limited set of attributes, only a small percentage of the selection are good catches. therefore, when running the simulation, it's certain that quite a few bad matches will take place -- and in fact, for the "best" person, they will be constantly be matched with inferior mates -- and for the "worst" person, again they will also be constantly matched with superior mates -- which means that, there's no such thing as a good match. in reality, 5 attributes is quite limited -- so imagine instead if there were 64 attributes: there'd be one "best" and one "worst" and 18,446,744,073,709,551,614 others distributed over the middle. as the number of attributes increases, the number of options increases exponentially -- so now imagine this from the perspective of earth: if children have a lot of the "good" attributes, and adults have a lot of the "bad" attributes, in order to maintain a balanced system, the worse a person is, they'll always get paired with better matches in order to ensure that there's never too big of gaps in the frequency spectrum. all goods must be matched with bads and bads with goods to ensure that all possiblities are accounted for (and yes also best with worst). this is unfortunately how it goes. there's no way around it, other than to go 2nd-ray and say, "sorry, I'm only attractive to these sets of qualities", limiting the attraction spectrum significantly.
	the other thing I should say about this, is that attraction works based on conceptual/emotional resonance, and the attributes (which is really more about emotion and mood) system of ensuring nothing is too good or too bad is a symbolic system (the saturnian-system). though, physical appearance (which is a reflection of our perception) works as a pretty good safeguard, cause for example if there's a particularly sour dude that feels pretty awful, it's pretty unlikely that he'll be too attracted to sleep with a particularly sour woman that also feels pretty awful -- though they will be attracted to one another cause of similar perception of how things are -- which allows them to make good conflict -- though it's often times the case that sour dudes hang together and sour women also hang together, but usually not together. so, whil
so, when I refer to a manifestation being "too good" -- what I mean is that the manifestation doesn't have enough "bad" attributes to it to balance out all of the good -- and so then, in order to have the manifestation, bad things need to happen to balance it out and ensure a broad spectrum.
	it's often the case that some 2nd-ray emitter will have a set of things that he (it's usually a he -- cept isis in egypt) determines are the things that he wants, and so in order to be able to attract only the things that he wants, usually a large amount of opposite is created to balance it out (slave labour/prostitution/etc). if the 2nd-ray doesn't produce a continuous spectrum, eventually the attraction spectrum will start to attract unwanted/unexpected things, and the system will fall down. so, from their perspective, it's always good to have a large source of unwanted, if there's going to be a manifestation of wanted.
I'm not like the normal 2nd-rays though, cause I don't want to have to use a source of unwanted to balance out a manifestation of wanted. I personally don't think it's necessary, and have come to find that I like to just feel good/neutral pretty much all of the time. the other thing that I do differently is that I'm attractive to all kinds of "unwanted" vibration, but because of my perception, I don't perceive it as unwanted. therefore, I can continually perceive "unwanted" and not really have it bother me -- though I admit, that I still have quite a ways to go on this capability. I want to keep expanding this capability further, cause I think that it's fully possible to take in any/all frequencies and to only output what's wanted to me -- which is kinda like the opposite of 2nd-ray (which is attractive to only certain frequencies, yet outputting as best as possible a continuous/white spectrum (of wanted/unwanted)).

### 2024-12-23 22:32 - output vs reflection

I talked to you a little bit about this concept in person today, and I also wanted to write it out, so that it gets evolved (so I present it even better next time), and also I want to practise a new way of trying to get the idea out there: the basic idea here is that all things attracted, come with an energy potential to them. I like to think of them as something like "cosmic rays" or muons (depending on if it's an emitted particle or if it's a received idea/concept). let's just take the cosmic ray as the example (a very fast moving proton/concept) and let's say that I've been trying to figure something out -- or I want to have some kind of manifestation happen, so I'm attractive to these sorts of ideas flying aruond. when the idea hits me, I get that "aha!" moment and it collides with me and my perception, sometimes causing a discombobulation (when this happens, I often feel the aha as a realisation that many new things will need to be rethouht, because I could be wrong on some things, or maybe that my world-view has shattered a bit, and will need some reworking). in any case, the impact of the idea usually augments a lot of my previous perception (which is what attracted it in the first place), and so combined with the new idea, my brain is able to then translate that idea into some kind of thought (as a realisation or a plan of action) or an action itself where I suddenly feel inspired/motivated to do something.
	it doesn't really matter where these ideas come from -- because I think that not only does the sun, other stars, and earth all emit "comsmic rays", but so do other people -- so really it could come from anywhere (even from "source" or "the universe") -- so it doesn't matter where it came from, because the idea resonates with me (otherwise I wouldn't have received it), and that I was in the right place at the right time to be able to actually receive it.
then, once I've translated that received idea/concept/emotion into words/thoughts/action, the cool thing about it is that the energy that I received from the impact is like the fertilization process whereby a seed gets a conceptual/emotional impact from a source which sets the creative process into motion. given the brain's neuronal pattern (or the biological machinery inside of the seed) that idea sets into motion a whole bunch of processes that eventually turn into something bigger (or a plant/animal/human). in my experience, the whole process of receiving an idea and turning it into action happens completely automatically -- so, I tend to think of it as a "reaction" to the emotional/concneptual input that I received.
	the lower "resistance" that I am (ie, the less contradictory beliefs that I have which oppose the machinery naturally producing the action necessary to turn that idea into reality), the more that process is completely reactionary, and feels as if I was just acting on instinct.
	however, if I have more resistance to the actions/words/thoughts that the received idea produces (and by resistance, I mean neuronal/symbolic programming which says that I *shouldn't* say/think/do/believe that because of some kind of social/societal convention), then I will stop the reaction earlier on, and not say/think/do the thing that comes immediately to my mind. we're taught to be resistant, because there's a whole lot of people (and I was one of them) that just directly turn their emotion into action (ie, any person "driven by their emotions") *even if the action doesn't feel good to them*.
the important ingredient to becoming less resistant and being able to easily convert any received idea into action is really simple: if I *only* turn ideas that feel good to me directly into action, I'm fine -- and it always works out -- but if the idea doesn't feel good to me, then *I don't convert it into action* -- because that idea (though I received it for some reason, and I'm resonant to it in some way) *doesn't actually align with more core perception* (or "core self" -- the highest frequency part of my perception).
what's happening there, is I'm *reflecting* the received idea/concept/emotion back out into the world in the form of action/thoughts/words/etc. for kids and a lot of adults, that kind of behaviour is the lowest resistance thing that they do, because the energy expended is not their own, so reacting to received emotional stimulus is the least effort they need to make (though sometimes the consequences of the reaction are quite energetically draining, the initial reaction to the emotional stimulus always feels the least effort -- which is why dbt teaches "effective" not least effort, lol). I used to be quite a reactor to others' emotional stimulus, but I've found that it's not always what I want to do (even if it's effortless for me to react to them).
those who are not very receptive (ie, emitters), or only very selectively receptive typically don't have this problem with reaction like that, because they're doing the opposite thing: they've figured out the way that the world works (ie, their belief system), and so looking out through that belief system, they can identify things that don't align with their beliefs (of how things *should* be), and will want to try and affect change to get the world to conform to their (or society/government/church's) beliefs. likewise, in just the same way that they've got this big shield/structure around them that's strongly influencing others to act/behave in a certain way, that belief structure also prevents them from receiving ideas that don't conform to their beliefs, too -- so getting these sorts of received ideas (which fertilize the mind and germinate into something larger), isn't really a problem for those with strong beliefs -- simply because their own beliefs is their shield and form of perception.
	a funny correlary exists here as well. ben davidson would often say that earth's magnetic shield is lowering and that's the reason why more cosmic rays are pouring through. it's not the magnetic shield, but actually our symbolic "shield" -- the one that the "saturnian-system" creates (with the help of venus) not only modulates how the earth is perceived from the outside-in (just like how your beliefs shape how you appear to other people), but also it shapes how we see the night sky looking from the inside-out. earth (and therefore the saturnian-system by extension) is constantly losing more and more of it's beliefs (and for some reason, it seems that the shifts in the earth's belief system and my own seem to be pretty strongly correlated), and so without this symbolic shield, that's why the earth is "being bombarded" (receiving) more and more cosmic rays from the outside.
	the "symbolic shield" of both earth, and our own selves is a subatomic structure that is something like a medium -- a lattice structure which is all around in the solar system, and it modulates proton/electron/particle flow symbolically, because the lattice structure has logic to it, allowing certain protons/electrons/particles to pass or to be redirected based on some logic (literally like the inside of a microprocessor, redirecting electrons and protons and stuff based on logic and conditions). that shield is what I call the "saturnian-system", and the conditions and structure there ensure that the ideas/concepts ("cosmic rays") received are redirected to the proper time and place, based on their set of conditions.
	what I think ben is complaining about, is that (especially when I was star-watching), there was a tremendous influx of these cosmic rays (you could think of me as like a huge funnel of them laying on the ground, receiving them, transforming them and sending them out) -- and so because I was bringing so many of these ideas in and distributing them around, different people were becoming resonant to ideas in a way that they wouldn't otherwise be resonant to them, and so it was largely bypassing the saturnian-system logic, allowing people to receive ideas (cosmic rays) that didn't go through the proper channels (btw, this is another reason why I've stopped watching stars -- because of how difficult it makes for the operators of the saturnian-system to keep things orderly and predictable in the way that they want).
anyway, the same thing happens when I'm reflecting a person or an environment: I feel the emotional output of a person (part of a person's perception is attractive (the desire/perception bit) and part of it is emissive (the symbolic/belief system bit)), and feeling their emotion, their emotional output (or beliefs structure which influences/pushes my protons/concepts) causes me to do things which align to their expectations (actually isn't the best word, because expectation is a combination of desire (what I want to happen) and belief (what I believe will happen)) -- or instead maybe I should say their "projection" (ie, the combination of how they feel about the concepts in the situation, and how they believe those concepts will interact) -- and so I sorta fit their "projection" of the situation (or expectation, depending if the person has desire or not). the emotions/projections/desires that I receive from them then cause me to be inspired to do/say/think things. that could either be really a nice interaction if they're desiring and believing (expecting) a nice interaction -- or it could be a really terrible one. all in all, it definitely has a lot to do with their beliefs/projections -- and behaving/manifesting their beliefs/projections about me and the situation is literally effortless for me (lol -- kinda sucks).
because nobody wants me to constantly be reacting in a way which upsets things, I have been told (even by you) that I need to actually create an operating system for myself so that I don't say/do things which others will disapprove of or respond negatively to. in order to do that, that requires me to create more "resistance" by adding logic and conditions to my surrounding "symbolic shield" (which exists primarily in the mind), ensuring that when those conditions are met the protons/electrons in my mind are redirected/stopped/transformed to fit the paradigm that the person wants m5 to operate in. it's way easier when the emotion received feels bad (and I'm still not 100% perfect at this, because I often times like to react) to just absorb the emotion, and instead of reacting to it in the moment, to instead just take it all in and transform it internally. therefore, the only thing that my "symbolic shield" does now, is simply to just transform stuff into more general and easier to process bits, which I can then behave properly in. it is actually possible to no longer be reactionary to other people -- and I'm kinda still in the learning process for it. [as an example of a faulty one, is that when a person does not believe	me, or is accusing me of something that's not true, I still believe I need to defend myself so that they know that *I'm different than they way they believe me to be* -- almost like I need to set them straight and get their beliefs about me to align with my beliefs about myself. the funny thing about it, is that's completely senseless -- because I'm actually in the process of lowering resistance to such an extent that I'm essentially going to completely lose my own identity (ie, no more emission/beliefs anymore) and everyone is just going to see theirself in me -- to which I will then begin my next stage, where instead of reflecting their own concept/perception of theirself back to them unmodified, instead I'll *transform* how they see me/theirself into something that I like/desire (which will have to be much higher frequency for it to work). so -- when they look at me, they'll see a higher frequency version of theirself that they'll interpret everyone individually in their own way -- making me actually become the most attractive person. right now, while I'm still in this inbetween stage where I'm attractive and reflective (without transformation), I'm still difficult to be around -- but it'll get (A LOT) better, trust me]

### 2024-12-24 00:29 - evolution of desire

another concept that we discussed tonight was attraction. as I was explaining the idea I felt a little bit of dissonance in what I was saying -- which could mean that I have it wrong, so this is an attempt to reiterate what I told you tonight in my way of speaking (ie, so I'm less of a reflection of you -- and I'm less trying to explain the concept in a way which you can understand [cause here in these documents, I tend to write in a way which is more similar to how I see the concept (cause I don't feel like you when I'm writing here), rather than trying to approach the concept from the way that I feel your perspective]). I'll just start from the beginning of the idea and work my way toward the part where I felt the dissonance, and try to figure it out from there.
the concept is evolution-of-desire: at first we see something outside of ourselves that we want (ie, someone else has it, or I can imagine how the world/environment would be if such a thing existed outside of myself and I were able to interact with it). that thing could be anything from a material thing, a relationship, a circumstance, event, etc (anything that can be desired). those things are always/usually perceived as something *outside* of me, which *will make me feel a certain way* -- so, if I want to be rich, it's usual that I want the feeling of freedom, security, and/or power that I think money will give me -- and so I desire to be rich, in order to feel that way. or, let's say that I want a relationship with a person -- again, that desire for the other person is because perhaps that person makes me feel a certain way (ie, lust, secure, valued, heard, etc.) -- or maybe that person has a quality that I want (ie, they are confident in certain situations, and being around them I can be that way too, and I want it for myself too). no matter how it works out, the attractive aspect of the person is a *feeling* that, I feel, if I can get a relationship going with them, I will feel like that.
therefore (and this is the most important bit), anything that anyone desires is so that they can feel a certain way. that feeling which they want appears now temporally at the end of a timeline. this is "the great attractor at the end of time" -- the feeling that you would have if you have everything that you want (ie, the "source"/attractive highest frequency vesion of yourself). I like to think of it as this giant black hole at the end of the main timeline of my life, but in actuality, it's just my "core self" -- the part of my perception which is only-attraction.
	concepts can be thought of as spherical representations of vibration -- so, they have infinitely many layers to them, where one layer will either be resonant with another, or it'll be opposite to the other layers. it's easiest to think of concepts as having an outer fascade and an inner core -- and that core even has a core, which has a core, (forever because there are infinitely many higher harmonics). it's also helpful to think of them as having two counter-rotating parts to them: the core (which has a core) rotates in one direction, while the outer part rotates in the opposite direction. at the boundary where these primary layers interact (for example, for a main-sequence-star (or the concept of an expectation), the inner/core atractive part can be thought of as 1st-ray/desire and the outer liquid/water emissive part is structure/belief) -- and between the two is this warzone astral part where the two layers are in constant battle. all structure/belief which isn't moving outward (emitting) is constantly moving more and more toward the core where it will interact with the largest (lowest frequency) oppositely spinning (attractive) particles in the outermost part of the core (which are the lowest frequency concepts of the desire). the interactions that the lowest frequency desire and the highest frequency (ie, the most lofty/ideal) of structure/beilief causes constantly those particles to be smashed to bits (kinda like in the LHC) to which the resulting particles will either augment the outer belief or inner attraction/desire.
	depending on which type of layer (emissive/belief or attraction/desire) is on the outside, a concept can be  classified as either be primarily emissive (like main-sequence-stars) or primarily attractive (I call these "black-holes") which are quite similar to the core of our sun (or other "white dwarfs") where the outermost part of them is usually rigid, and the protons that compose it are spinning in the opposite direction from the way that the sun is spinning (whatever way that is, cause chirality matters). that means that they're highly attractive at very very high frequencies because the protons that compose the rigid structure tightly fit together and are vibrating at a high frequency. because of their higher frequency, all other concepts which have any kind of resonance with these attractive concepts will continue to move up in speed toward the attractive concept's frequency (and this is why the inner attractive core to emissive concepts is constantly attracting the highest frequency beliefs into it). in short, interactions/collisions between concepts make smaller higher frequency paricles, which then organise into a structure which is then attracts other concepts to increase in speed -- so because of collision/interaction, everything is always getting faster and faster, and the things that we believe about things are constantly being broken down into smaller (more ideal) bits, allowing for a continually expanding/accelerating universe.
our	head and the concepts inside of it works in quite a similar way to an emissive star/proton, where our highest frequency (most lofty) percEption/beleifs are constantly being torn down and turned into desire/attraction -- so anything that anyone desires (and their beliefs on how to get it) is constantly being evolved as whatever way we think we're going to get what it is that we want, is constantly evolving into something higher frequency.
the way that I like to think about this evolution process is going from outer to inner: I think of it as having 3/4 basic steps to it (where the hidden fourth, is a combination of two of the steps).
first, I have a sense that I *need* something -- and this is largely a function of our survival code/program. when something threatens our survival (from the mental perspective, survival isn't bodily function (though it can be), survival is actually the maintenance of our beliefs/world-view), we think we *need* something. for example, let's say that there is a loud noise that's being made by someone or something -- and it's really irritating to me. that noise is causing me to feel bad -- and since my "core self" is highly attractive to feeling really really good, my first conclusion is that I *need* the noise to stop. it threatens my mental survival, cause if the noise continues on, I will be forced to continue to experience negative emotion in the form of irritation.
	emotions feel like they're going to last forever, because they don't have a temporal aspect to them (they're perceived from the infinite perspective: every/all/none/always/forever -- because the way that I feel *now* is the only time that exists. unless I do something to tune myself into another concept/emotion, I will continue to experience the same dissonant feeling that I feel now, forever. everyone and everything can be viewed as the cause, because there's no limit of time and space to emotions -- meaning that (literally) *anything/anyone* in the universe could be the influence of that emotion. there aren't any limits to that vibration -- and the frequency of anger (quite a low one) will be exactly the same in 12000BC vs 2048AD -- and so no matter what time I'm in, I'm perceiving that anger now.
		there's a bit of nuance to what I said there, because each emotion has a whole lot of subtle details/concepts to it, which sum to be the "perception" of its trigger,-- and the interaction/interference of all of those concepts together with what a person's "core self" is attracting, produces a waveform which resonates strongly with anger. anger can then be thought of kindof more like a color in the emotional/conceptal spectrum, and so just like how blending different coloured light produces other colours, so does belending together concepts produce another colour light. the thing that makes the emotion unique to a single person, is that the conecpts are (because they're perceived inside of the body/head) going to automatically be combined with the person's core conceptual structure as well. [it actually just occurred to me that when I talk about the emotions being reflective of the concepts/perception stored inside of the head -- I'm talking about my own experience. that may not be true for everyone. it's quite possible that others have their concepts mixed with the concepts present in their regenerative, heart, and pineal chakras -- aligning their concepts to their solar soul's perception. I don't want to sound like I've transcended already, but I get the feeling that things perhaps work a bit differently for me -- a subject I'd like to explore in the future]
after a while of trying to get others to conform to my *needs*, that desire softens a bit and now I just *want* the thing outside of me to become a part of my reality. in opposite to need (which often times shows itself in negative/subtractive form), when I *want* something, I desire for it to be included/added to my reality. so, continuing the example of someone/something making an irritating noise, instead of needing them to stop (even though it's possible to say "I *want* you to stop making that noise", it's still said in the form of need, which is threatening to my mental survival) -- now I *want* a different more harmonious sound (or no sound at all). the difference between need and want is that want is only added or different -- and again, it's also usually wanting something outside of myself to be added/different.
next up, is the (hidden) third evolution of desire -- which is to *create* the thing that I think will create the feeling I want for myself. often times it's not possible to find the thing that will do the emotional trick -- or it's just not available for some reason -- so, to solve the problem, and to get the thing, "necessity is the mother of invention" summons the inventor to find a way to create something outside of theirself which (seemingly) is possible to make the feeling of the reality of that desire, possible.
finally, the fourth (or third depending on how symbolically creative a person feels theirself to be) aspect is the *I AM* evolution -- and this one is the one that everyone is looking for -- and what becomes the result of all of the transformations on perception (and evolutions of desire) into the person's "core self".
	the reason why I call the *create* phase of evolution the "hidden" third aspect, is because it combines the *I AM* aspect and the *want* aspect together. anyone who has been creative knows that the outward expression (emission) of their creativity is always going to be a reflection of their perception. so, along the path to create the thing that's desired, the first iteration will always be limited by the creator's perception. it's impossible to create something which is beyond the capability of the person's perception, and so therefore will always fall short of being a perfect representation of that desire in physical form. each iteration of the project will be more similar to the desire, but ultimately limited by the perception/beliefs (expectation) of those involved in its creation. each iteration of the creation (because it's symbolic) will ultimately fail to meet all desired aspects, and so will fall short of a perfect rendering of that desire. therefore, as each iteration of the creation improves, it will ultimately bring the creator closer and closer to the realisation of their desire, because, to find the improvement the creator's perception has to become more in line with the desire. they are, each iteration, becoming more and more able to feel/perceive in the way that they are building the creation to do for them. when I finally create what I want to create, *I AM* the creation.
it happens automatically, that as a person focuses on a cOncept that exists externally, the focuser begins to resonate similarly to the perceived concept, beginning their attraction to that concept. in fact, every concept perceived since birth, is ultimately being attracted to the perceiver -- and they will ultimately become speed up and become resonant with every concept ever perceived, ever. the path to become every concept perceived/desired (focused on) is different for everyone. therefore, since everyone becomes all things that they perceive, obviously, it's important to *find a way to perceive all things in a way that's wanted*. until that happens, unwanted will continue to occur. inotherwords, when a person/entity is able to perceive theirself as (become) everything that they've perceived, and also be attractive to it, then that person is theirself their own little universe.
	actually, everyone in physical is their own little universe already -- but that universe is pretty short-lived, and not at all self-sustaining. if you (like God) can contain all, good/evil, unwanted/wanted, all aspects of everything perceived, and find a way to transform that into something that's wanted, there will be no more unwanted manifesting in your experience, and you'll "live forever" as you have become all things desired (even the bad/evil stuff) and that no longer causes failure. like the (undying) stars, the symbolic stuff that's no longer realistic is constantly being recycled into desire, and so even the "unwanted" stuff is actually nothing more than fuel for the expansion of "all that is" (ie, *all that I've experienced/perceived*).

that's the "basic" (lol) concept of evolution-of-desire in its latest form [though I already know ways I could say some things better, I'm getting tired of typing, lol] -- and so now back to the conversation tonight. I was explaining to you that whenever I've ever felt physical attraction to someone, *they have concepts that I want* (concepts I'm attracted to) -- and so for example I've had it happen many times that different kids have been physically attracted to me. when this first happened, I didn't really know what to do about it -- but at the time I was assured by abraham (channeled by esther hicks) that if it feels good, and the universe is providing it, then it's just fine. they also assured me that the stuff that I *thought* I wanted, wasn't actually what I *really* wanted. boy was that true -- and so after finally allowing myself to be OK with the idea, I finally allowed myself to believe that I could have something that society says is illegal. to make a long story short, there were quite a few evolutions of desire along the way (which is why I write the above concept with so much clarity), and it turns out that I was looking for something *outside* of myself to create a feeling that I thought I wanted. after focusing on that feeling (how kids feel) for extended periods of time, I became really attractive to that feeling, which (because of society's rules) is an impossiblity for me to get as something outside of myself -- which meant, that in order for me to continue to grow as a person, *I have to become the thing that I desire*.
	well, as I said, all things that we desire, the outward manifestation of it is just the (symbolic) representation of the feeling that we want to feel upon attaining that desire (ie, the attractor at the end of the timeline). so, unfortunately I kinda set myself up for a "do or die" sort of scenario, where I had to actually find a way to feel like the kids do (acquire the concepts that they have) -- or find a way of peacing out of reality, cause I wasn't able to continue on going the previous way. in a sense, you could say that their attraction was kinda like a bait that, thinking I could get something that could possibly work out to be a better relationship, instead I had to find a way to become like them (at a much older age). that obviously was somewhat difficult to do, but the essentials of it are this: kids (before their "taught" by their parents to follow a different guidance) are 100% a slave to their emotions, completely driven to do what they feel all of the time. I'm like that too, so I had to figure out how to go back to being like that, and still operate in society. obviously, it's difficult -- and no matter how hard others try to encourage me to follow some sort of symbolic set of rules (setup by society, government, or whatever), like a child, I refuse to follow the guidance that's being given to me from outside -- and instead trust my emotions fully, 100%. if it feels good, then it's fine -- and if it feels bad, then it's not fine. the way I feel about my next decision/action tunes me into the timeline that I'll traverse, with the result/end of that timeline being the way that I feel amplified. it's really quite simple -- and it turns out that makes me pretty youthful and childlike.
however, along the way to becoming the thing that I desire, I'm gaining a whole lot of concepts that make me quite attractive (and repulsive) to quite a few others. that attraction is perceived (usually) as physical/sexual attraction -- and so sensing that others want to know my concepts, I try and convey them in a more and more intelligible way all the time. they think that by having a physical/sexual interaction with me, they'll be able to acquire my concepts -- and to some extent, that's true; they'll feel similarly to the way that I feel about things, without having the experience to back it up -- which is sorta a really big problem. I experience the same thing that they would experience,--
	lemme explain: the way that a child feels during their really young years (less than 6yo and even earlier), is when they're in cOnceptual mode (like I'm in all the time now -- and maybe you are too to some extent) -- which is just a mode where I'm highly attractive (black) to the way that others feel around me. the way that others feel around me builds my perception, and so by feeling them and their emotions in various situations, I conclude (based on the way I felt their emotion) it's good/normal/powerful/whatever to feel the way that my example perceivers feel --
		the way that I feel them, isn't entirely how they feel to normal people (cause it's relative, not absolute) -- [it stopped working in the relative way sometime before my brain haemorrhage (probably when I was really young) but has worked in the relative way ever since -- cause I got to start over with my left-side being 0yo/born-again -- all the way up until my RH was disabled in 2017] so for example, if someone experiences anger and I feel that as a real strong sense of power -- like an overcoming force that feels quite good. the reason for that is that anger is *relative* to the previous emotion that they felt -- usually something like powerlessness, ineptitude, or some kind of dissatisfaction. so, in that sense, anger feels like quite an empowering emotion to me -- even though society denounces it as not a good emotion to feel. however, if for example, the previous emotion that the person felt was quite a positive one (like for example, if they're excited about a project and then their kid interrupts them, and they switch to anger), then I feel the same anger as quite a negative emotion. it feels like a real downer, and that the person/situation that caused the anger should be forced to do something different (hence the reason why I've never wanted to tell others what to do, because unless someone is feeling excited about something, telling them what to do usually results in a very negative feeling -- whereas if we're both stoked about the project idea, and I tell them to get started on some aspect of the programming, that yields quite a positive feeling). [I've since figured out that I believe that relative concept/emotion form of perception is what children use to form their "core values" early on (by comparing one emotion to another) -- then I think around the time of 6yo or so, when their brain starts to begin to become symbolically active, "parenting" and the desire for children to not experience "bad" emotions, they're taught to suppress feelings like anger (which are positive in comparison to helplessness/fear/depression/defeat/etc) and so following directions, they comply, "forgetting" that all emotions are relative to the previous one (ie, when one emotion emitted/received feels better/worse than another) and so they're now taught to live life relative to some other absolute like God/parent/teacher -- and that converts them into a cog in the machine (relative now to parent/teacher/God's guidance), no longer able to feel the contrast between emotions anymore]
	so, as I gather a lot of these sorts of feelings, I teld to mimic and behave like others do, because I liked the feeling (good examples of this are zaryn's douchebaggery, t-stance, mimicing rich pijos, etc). I often times thought that feeling like	my example feelers was the way to achieve the feeling that they felt. so, I had some pretty serious misunderstandings because I would display the "wrong" emotions at inappropriate times. the difficulty that I experienced is that I felt quite good about a lot of "bad" things (misconduct/behaviour/etc), because my example feelers felt quite powerful in many situations (like for example, many times when zaryn would present me with a feeling of powerlessness or inability to achieve some desired goal, often times my reaction/solution was to inflict damage on the company/entity that was impeding us -- and zaryn would frequently tell me "you can't just ... them because they're not ..."). obviously (to me), revenge/anger was a solution to the problem of feeling helpless/defeated/hopeless -- so I eventually had to figure out that I didn't want to do stuff like that.
so what would happen is that their form of perception would feel quite OK/good about many really bad/awful things, and so feeling OK about those things, this is the same problem that puberty produces: they (or in m/ case I) have to figure out a way of behaving which supports that part of my perception which feels good/OK about the thing. that's quite a difficult thing, because if I'm attractive to all of these things which are quite awful, that's what I continually notice over and over -- and yet I'm somehow feeling good about it at the same time (as an example, I have (probably from others' perspective) quite a low opinion of women, largely because that's the perspective that I grew up around and was "normal" to me to feel that way about them, cause that's what my example feelers felt like. the perspectives that I had (ie, "women are always lieing and cheating, and just out there to take advantage of guys with money") would cause anticipation of such a thing (which is largely the reason why I stayed away from them) and that gave me anxiety, so I had to find a way to make that perspective feel good to me -- which in the end made me realise that there are quite a few ambitious women out there, and to really start to appreciate the marylyn monroes and the ones that would "fuck their way to the top"). I still maintain possibly the lowest opinion of women that I know of, and I sorta expect the worst from them all the time (assuming that I want them to make me feel the way that I desire to feel) -- so to kinda get around all of that (cause it's never-ending), I just have to no longer worry about them making me feel the way I want to feel (cause it's not going to happen) -- and it's always been the case that every experience I've had with women, I've consistently felt worse than before -- cause they *must* conform to my expectations of them.
therefore, because I'm attractive to all of these terrible things, yet at the same time my core self feels really good about it, I have to find a totally different way of perceiving reality: instead of needing/wanting/creating something outside of me to make me feel the way I desire, I have to figure out how to have those concepts for myself. also, it works out well that we live in a society where under-age kids are off-limits (and I would automatically be blamed for any infraction), because that means that I now have to learn to become neutral to them. as I mentioned, acquiring their concepts is easy: I just focus on the feeling they emit for an extended period of time, and that means that I become attractive to that feeling -- so that means that others that also feel like that are going to also be attracted to me -- but obviously, in today's society, that's not good and is punishable (plus, I already went through the whole ["too good" thing](#2024-12-22-2230---too-good)), so it's actually quite a benefit, because I'm no longer needing/wanting/creating something outside of me to make me feel that way (when my own perception/belief even prevents that from being possible -- cause it's obvious to me that the opposite has and will continue to happen) -- so then what ended up happening, is that as I became attractive to those concepts (of essentially what it's like to perceive from a child's perspective), a bunch of children (and adults who don't hate children and want to be like them) started becoming really attracted to me.
often times, I would experience mutual attraction to these children and adults that were attracted to my youthful form of perception -- and so I have to find a way to become neutral to them. if I feel attraction from them, they have concepts that I want to have, so I'd focus on them and the good-feeling of the attraction, and then I'd have circumstances and events show up, which would give me the opportunity to find a way to attain their concepts. as usual, it often times involved conflict or some kind of other disagreement (battle of the opinions), and basically, I just have to follow my emotion on this one and gain the ability that they have to feel good about the same thing. as such, I've learned to feel quite good about rules, and all sorts of other degmas and limiting aspects of reality that I (used to) find to be utter nonsense. once I do that, they're no longer attractive to me, and so now I don't need to worry about getting pulled into their attraction, and I can remain the centre.
[the part that I felt dissonance on was when I was explaining to you how attraction works, I was saying that if the two concepts are slightly different in vibration from each other (which is always true btw, cause otherwise they'd be merged into the same concept), then as they approach each other, there's going to be a feeling of attraction as the frequencies get more similar (converging) -- and a feeling of repulsion when the frequencies are diverging. I think a better way to say what I was trying to say, is that when I gain neutrality to them, it's as we're now orbiting each other. the orbit is never a perfect circle, so there will always be moments of attraction and repulsion, but overall, the effect is that they're no longer going to hit/collide with me anymore, and so we experience periods of attraction (coming together) and periods of repulsion (going away). I have to maintain my distance and ensure no direct interaction occurs, because then if that were to happen, the one I interacted with *must* become like me (at that time anyway), meaning that (actually, I explained it above) that they would have a massive increase in perception and feel/conceptualise like I do (a very big problem because no experience is there to back it up, so they'll have to learn by experience how to feel good about the (good/bad/ugly) things they're attracted to). I don't like swinging from different extremes like that in order to remain in balance/orbit, so I choose the "middle path" -- so if they actually want to become like me, all they need to do is just to focus on how I feel (that feels good to them) and experience that feeling for a while until their life presents them with the opportunity to get those concepts for theirselves. it sounds like a stupid idea, but when they figure that out, they'll be able to feel like the way they want to feel *all of time* -- not just under certain circumstances/conditions. --- OK, I'm done. I've been typing for hours and hours (concept is thoroghly explained though). good night!]
