### 2024-12-08 23:25 - evolution of desire

when we were talking tonight about stuff, I omitted a pretty significant detail (and potentially gave the wrong impression as well), mostly because I didn't really know how to summarise it in any consise or meaningful way. looking back on it just now I might have given the impression that I was a bit upset with these various young girls taking interest in me, and also that I didn't know what to do about it. neither of those impressions are true.
like I mentioned, late 2012 the raquel thing was totally done. I got beat up by a guy wanting 5eur that I had for another crack rock and had to move away from alcobendas (a suburb of madrid where I was living -- the house raquel and I got). having that whole world crash down to bits, I had to rethink things consierably. you see, all of my life, the stuff that I *believe* is possible, is. I have *always* been able to do the things that I think are possible, and to a large extent, the futures that I believed were going to happen, also did. I came to spain with full belief that tuenti was going to be a massive success, and that I was going to begin to reshape the world to be the one that I lived in, starting with that social network. however, it obviously didn't work out, and my opinion of it is that the network posed a pretty serious threat to various competitors, and their desire for such a network to not exist was pushed against in the "saturnian-system" (the visual/symbolic system whereby time can be manipulated to produce the reality that they desire) -- and so after trying so hard to push out my ideas out on to the world, I finally had to give up on that whole thing and just let it go. also, I should mention that when I met raquel, she was just a receptionist at a hotel, but I felt an extreme amount of affinity with her, which is why I was so drawn to talk to her. after she invited me to barcelona and we got together, again, I had full belief that I'd met essentially the woman of my dreams. I had realised that such a structured and analytical woman like patricia wasn't what I was really looking for -- and again, my optimism lead me to believe (and I had lots of "visions" and premonitions of it) that we were going to have this amazing relationship, and that she was going to be able to really help me bring my ideas out to reality.
	however, I think this too was thwarted becuase, I'm pretty sure that I would have figured out star-watching on the attic patio that we had, yet the landlord (also named raquel) decided to put in a big gazebo right before we moved in. there were also a number of other things that derailed our relationship as well, but they're too numerous to mention. either way, looking back on it, I'm pretty sure that relationship also fell apart cause of the influence of the saturnian-system too.
with her gone, my whole system of "creating reality" (through my belief) just simply isn't working. I couldn't seem to get any of the stuff to work out the way that I believed they were going to work out (though it did work previously)	-- so distraught by thinking that all is lost, I finally started learning about how "law of attraction" works. I recognised pretty quickly that visualisation and belief are really inferior techniques -- and that emotion and my perception of reality really is the precursor to every manifestation. unsure of what it is that I actually did want (and neither did I want to try to visualise/believe it (cause this is output)), I turned to attraction instead, which essentially states that my reality will reflect how I feel. so, I gave up all of my attempts to try and figure out what it is that I wanted beforehand (like I did with with patricia where I calculated prior to going to berlin that a girl exactly like her would be what I was looking for -- then getting to berlin, there she was -- but my calculations were off a bit, because it turned out perhaps I was wrong). so, instead of outputting what I want, I was just going to feel good about things, and avoid all of the drama chicks (cause they felt bad to me) and just *allow* the one that felt like me to show up. I essentially turned asexual, because as I encountered various girls passing through my life, sure many were physically attractive, but I didn't like how they *felt* (ie, they were usually obsessing over things and experiencing emotions (drama) that I didn't like how it felt). I stayed asexual for quite a while, essentially finding nobody that felt good to me.
as I worked with marcos on afinaty (the social network based on affinity), our disagreements provided me with a whole lot of opportunity to learn to feel good no matter the circumstances (I'd worked on another social network previously called essembly that also had idological proximity, and from my experience there, I felt like I had a much better grasp on what he should create, yet he didn't want to do things *my way*, and that made me angry). I finally gave up and just started to do things his way, deciding that I preferred to feel good, rather than be right or to have things go my way. I really started to get good at that, and I was really starting to feel really good pretty consistently, when his daughter (andrea) started to become a major factor. apparently me feeling pretty good and having the ability to feel good in siutations where I'm not getting my way makes me pretty attractive. I didn't really know what to think at first, but I have the opinion that the universe provides, and because she is/was so reflective and pretty young, she felt a lot like me -- which is the feeling that I like, because I actually like myself -- so I felt good about her. the problem obviously being her age -- and at 11, she was just about to start entering into puberty where her symbolic/logical mind starts to turn on, and the structure that she's been picking up all of her childhood (like how to behave and stuff) starts to conflict with her emotional mind. as an example, it was incomprehensible to her that she couldn't go after something that's so attractive to her (me) just because society says that there are age limits and stuff. so, instead of following what feels good to her, as her logical mind starts to engage, puberty starts because now she the rules say that she can't get/do the things that she wants -- so automatically (because all of her examples fight and complain and push against the rules), she starts fighting all of the rules just like all of her adult examples in her life do (puberty in a nutshell). at the same time as she's starting to fight the structure, I'm learning the opposite, which is to ignore/follow the rules, and instead of feeling bad about the restrictions put on me, to instead find ways to feel the way I want and *attract* good-feeling manifestations, instead of trying to will the way i want it to be. (essentially, I'm attractive to her because I have a capability that she'll want to have when the rule system starts to come crashing in on her good-feeling world with all of the "you can'ts").
I was a bit upset that she showed up and started to wreck things, because my ability to feel good meant that the website was starting to do well and gain traction. also I was learning to work with marcos and be able to perform the tasks that were necessary *inside of his rules*. so I actually was starting to see/believe the website was going to be a success. *finally*, I was going to start creating something I wanted to create (ideological proximity was also one of the things I wanted to add to tuenti) -- and she shows up and starts to cause problems.
after some thinking on it, I decided that if she is what the universe is giving me, and also if I can keep up this pattern of feeling good despite the constraints imposed on m5, I figured it would actually work out -- so I softened to the idea that this could actually be something really awesome the universe is providing me. I talked with marcos very openly about it, and encouraged him to let me start hanging out with her before her puberty started to really derail her mind. I figured that I could help her to see that she can feel the way that she wants to feel *despite the imposed structure*. so, I ended up being fully OK with it. I didn't have any shame about it, and I was fully open about the thing to everyone. I found it quite strange that a young girl would like me, but obviously it would probably have to be that way because the way that parenting is done, is to essentially tell kids that they can't do things, and that they have to behave in a certain way (usually so that the parent isn't caused to feel bad by their behaviour). all older girls will have gone through puberty, and (unless they've learned how to feel good on their own) will be requring conditions (most notably their relationship with me) to make them feel good. I figured it would be impossible to find a girl that's actually able to feel good in spite of the restrictions placed on them by their social and cultural structure -- so obviously, younger it will have to be.
	I should also mention that there are a whole lot of difficulties that remain: I basically have nothing in common with someone so young, and I can't really talk with them about anything that interests me either -- and neither could they actually help me out with stuff that I wanted to work on (back then I was programming most of my waking hours, not like now where I'm pretty idle). so basically we're most entirely incompatible. I had no idea how to solve that problem, other than just figuring it out as I go, and again just sorta finding a way to feel good no matter the situation. I had no idea how it would work out, and I was fairly certain that our extreme incompatibility would cause me to be a pretty terrible boyfriend(?) anyway -- cause mostly all of what I wanted to do was to create something where I was able to find other people who are ideologically and conceptually similar to me. (inotherwords, I wanted to create something that would allow me to find other people I could actually talk and hang around -- someone on my level -- and typically I've found those people to be (sometimes much) older than me). so I was wanting to create something that would obsolete her. also I wanted others to know what I had figured about about how easy it is to attract/manifest things based on how I *feel* about my reality. there was no guarantee that she would have any interest in any of that, so I actually figured it'd be a pretty short relationship too, with her going off to the other (macho/handsome/atheletic) guys that could perform in the ways that she wanted them to perform for her. as much as I wanted it to work, I was quite unsure about the viability of it. too many incompatibilities. on that note though, I'm really actually glad it failed.
after another set of difficulties (the mental institution and getting my right hemisphere turned off), I came to pueblo where the difficulties continued. as you'll eventually read in my really old writings, I didn't know how to get rid of this "nosebook"/"the network" problem, because they were manipulating my life and constantly confining me to have less and less. obviously I hadn't learned the thing that I was intending to teach to andrea so well, because I let my ideas of how nosebook *should* treat me cause me to increase intense amounts of anger (a whole lot of it was experienced watching stars where we were talking tonight), and -- it took me a few years, but I started to really get it. I've been continually pressed more and more to the extreme all the way through my homelessness -- and I'd say that it's only been recently (last few months) where I don't really have any more anger left in me -- and I'm no longer trying to push to get anything I want anymore.
	real quick before I get to the main topic, I'd like to point out that I've figured out that the evolution of desire is essentially *I need (some thing/concept)* -> *I want (some thing/concept)* -> *I'll create (some thing/concept)* -> *I AM (that thing/concept)*. notice how anger is in the *need* category (I *need* someone to be/do something different). the reason why it makes us angry is because it threatens our sense of survival -- because the stuff that we *need* are the things that feel essential to survival. if there's no way to get that thing, that's depression or completely feeling defeated -- but when we're angry, it's a *motivating* force that causes us to feel like it's not completely impossible to get the thing we think we need. wanting is a lot more neutral, but that creates expectatons/beliefs, which when it happens, makes us feel good (like I thought I was going to feel after making tuenti, getting together with raquel, etc), and then there's the idea that "OK, if I can't get it from outside of me, then I'll create it myself". I experienced this multiple times in figuring that I could solve my problem of not being able to find anyone that's even remotely ideologically similar to myself could be solved by *creating* something that would produce the output that I desire. then, finally -- there's the idea that even to create the thing, all creations are an extension of the consciousness of the creator, so therefore, the creator has to have/be/embody the concept that they want to create. inotherwords, if I want something to feel good, I can *need* something to make me feel good, I can *want* something to make me feel good, I can *create* something to make me feel good, or I can *become* someone that feels good.
as I've passed my time in pueblo, I've come to realise that it's just not possible to find that thing outside of myself that I originally wanted. in the months leading up to my homelessness, I outlined a whole bunch of different things that I wanted to create,-- everything from new genetics (with 3X, 6X, or 10X pairs of cromosomes) to an idea where I'd launch a new artifcial moon of earth which would revolve around the equator and do a whole bunch of cool stuff. however,-- like I mentiond above, the reality of me creating these things is pretty slim to none. there's a whole saturnian-system designed to ensure that I must live within the rules that they have for me (ie, they don't want me making any websites or anything like that, and they also ensure that no underage relations ever occur -- or any sex at all, for that matter -- because they run their entire system on my right hemisphere, and sex would totally destroy their system). I don't have the resources to fight the saturnian-system, and at this point neither do I want to. I fully/radically accept their rules, and have any intention of trying to break them. I've passed the point where I can get any manifestation anymore because if that were to happen, it would break all of their rules. all visual/symbolic/astral systems involves rules and a hierarchy that I want nothing of. my destination is 3d, where there are no rules other than attraction. whenever they're ready (ie, when they can't hold back my attraction any further), they'll be forced to let go of me, and something entirely unexpected (something I cannot imagine) will manifest (I have no idea what it'll be). it's worth waiting for, and at this point, it's really not all that hard for me to feel the way I want to feel. I don't need anyone or anything to be different than how they are for me to feel good. therefore, my *only* job is to just feel the way that I want to feel, regardless of the rules. that's it. there's nothing more to it. they'll keep adding more and more rules to ensure to manifestation occurs, and I've come to figure out, *that's what I want* -- because eventually I'll be in the universe where there are no rules; only attraction.
	inotherwords, a manifestation is symbolic and quantifyable, which means it has rules -- so anything of that sort puts me in the universe of rules -- which I don't want. I *refuse* to go to that universe. I don't want rules. I like that things are constantly evolving and changing/improving as a reflection of my perception of it. anyone who tries to get me to go to the world of rules, is essentially trying to break the rules (lol) -- and they'll be stopped, I assure you.
so in closing: all is fine. there will be no underage girls at all, ever. no rules will be broken, and I have no interest in the worlds of higher dimensions. **all things are possible in 3d**

### 2024-12-09 21:04 - some thoughts for tonight

tonight you emitted a few concepts that I felt strongly enough that I wanted to comment on. for now I'll just pick the strongest one, because my intention is to kinda talk it through a bit -- mostly because I don't have a good feeling about it (though I recognise that my bad feeling isn't on the thing itself -- but on my own resistance to the thing). you mentioned how I shouldn't tell abby that I think school is a waste of time. I didn't understand, so I asked you to clarify and you said both that you hated school yourself, and that she also hates it -- however in contrary to the idea you said (essentially) that school is how she will learn, and it'll build character in her. I kinda disagreed by stating (through a story of my own) that the environment is where a lot of kids pick up a lot of resistant behaviour and reactions to authority and stuff. at the same time the thought popped into my head with the the emotion that you expressed your frustration that you can't homeschool her and stuff -- so I thought, "well, OK, but what if she were able to find an alternative where she could learn the things that she wanted." I also wondered had the idea pop into my head, "well, what if I were to teach her" -- and that second one is the one that I experienced so much resistance to. I expressed my reaction/response that resistance by talking to you in the car about how I can't assert my ideas into someone else's life (citing the example of me reflecting my mom), and also by telling you how I don't want to be the motivating force for someone else. I find the people that need someone to motivate them to be pretty much useless
	I think I said "a failure" -- because that concept for me has the implication of failure because a person who isn't self-motivated will judge their success/effectivity of their efforts based on the reaction of the motivator. also, I'm deeply opposed to the idea of motivating anyone because that explicitly makes me 2nd-ray, and I have no desire to be that.
		though it was OK with mom to play 2nd-ray a bit because I'm a reflection of her, so it's not my energy that's pushing her to make the decision that I think will be best, but her own energy that she's emitting toward me being reflected back to her. in that case, just like when I reflect someone else's anger back to them, there's no problem, because it's not m/ own emission -- but theirs. energetically, there's no consequence for me.
	I don't want to become the metric for how someone else perceives their reality, because I'm essentially making a copy of myself (or rather of my ideals). it's really important that everyone has the ability to come to their own conclusions their own unique way. I really feel that it's most important to have their own *desire* to feel good. what I mean is, if it's my desire for them to feel good, I'm their motivator -- and as long as I'm around, I'm the reason for their desire. a person only really becomes attractive when they *want to feel good* (and aren't looking for or using conditions to try and get there (ref: the part where I was talking about your body -- was my translation of the concept that if you actually want to feel good, that's what makes you feel and also look really good)). a person who wants to feel good has a youthfulness and joy about them that's quite notable. it happens to some people on drugs (conditions), and that's why others in that moment appear so much more attractive -- because, the person in that state of "addictive behaviour" *really wants to feel good* (by wanting more of the drug/sex/whatever condition).
		in that sense, (IMO) "addiction" isn't a bad thing -- just a bit misguided, because in that moment, the person thinks that it's the drug or whatever that will make them feel good -- but the important part to the "addictive behaviour" is actully desiring to feel better than they normally do. if a person can take that desire to feel good, and keep it going in sober life, and not use the condition and instead use their thoughts/perception to feel better about their present situation, they'll have figured out what I know, and are fully in control of how they feel. it takes a fair amount of practise, obviously -- because it's just so much easier to look for the condition to do the work of making them feel better, instead of adjusting their perception.
	however, I don't really know how to really instill that concept into someone,-- and it's quite a bit of an "out of the ordinary" perspective on addiction, that most people will fight me on. in their mind, different substances and behaviours are "bad" because they live in the black and white symbolic world of actions and conditions. those sorts of programs are installed by social and cultural (plus influence of family and friends) to ensure that people operate in a way that maintains a semi-orderly system without too much chaos. though my views are significantly different than most of those programs that tell a person how to operate/behave, I've come to those conclusions all by myself -- and though I adhere to them, I absolutely *do not* want to try and teach others to break/disobey the rules that the present social structure is trying to reinforce. also, my view *only works if the person actually wants to feel good for theirself*. nobody can make a person have the desire to feel good without the condition, other than theirself -- so my perspective on these "bad" behaviours are deeply subversive, and I prefer not to teach them to others (though they are the ones that I use myself).
however, let's just suppose for a moment that I were to teach abby or someone else the things that I believe are necessary to navigating life as an attractive person (instead of teaching them to fit into a program, do their work, get old, ugly, then die -- only to be replaced by the next person) -- well, the problem with it is mainly that I would likely be going pretty heavily against their parents (or whoever is responsible for them)'s desire for that person. this, along with many other difficulties, is the main reason why I couldn't be a parent. I would be doing everything all wrong, because I would be often times enabling a person to engage in "bad" behaviour (the same reason why I refuse to be a peer specialist, and keep my mouth shut on so many things regarding this stuff). I don't feel that I would be setting a good example to others, because I'm undermining the social structure that society depends on so much. I don't really feel good giving a kid fire and letting them play with it (though I know they'll be fine, the way it looks to those on the outside is quite problematic).
that's enough of the bad aspects and stuff I'm worried about -- cause there are som5 really good aspects to the idea. the last few weeks I've been going to my dbt class, and I find the emotion regulation module to be ultra complex and completely ineffective (actually yielding opposite results) for an attractive person. each time I go, I regularly think that the whole system out to be able to be simplified down into a form which a child can understand. it's really not all that difficult to understand emotions (IMO), and the last few weeks I've really been thinking a lot on how I could teach emotions to a kid in a simple way that they could understand. I have actually quite a few ideas and the outline/concept of how I would teach it is starting to come together well enough, I may try writing some of it out a bit tomorrow. I'm actually quite exhilerated to find a way to teach it -- because it's going to be something like the difference between imperative programming paradigm (the dbt way) to going to a functional way of programming, where the concepts are recursive. it's sorta hard to explain, but basically I use a system of good/bad feeling concepts, and then the action responses to those feelings are built up on the basic supposition that something that feels good, is something that I turn into action (which often times involves me saying/doing the wrong thing for people) -- and then, trusting my emotions above all else -- which means that when I say/do something wrong/inappropriate and someone trys to make me feel bad for doing something that felt good to me, I have to trust my own feelings over their projection of bad-feeling (which is usually rooted in the symbolic expectations of the social/religious/political/ideological program that they subscribe to). that causes me to have to just "go with it" and *not care what others think* -- just following my own emotions.
	I make it sound easy -- and I told you tonight that I don't really have anything that makes me feel bad anymore, however the thing that I still struggle with (believe it or not) is trying to act and express myself in a way which is least bothersome to others. I really should not give a shit, but that's actually still pretty hard for me. I'm pretty good at not being too embarrassed by stuff that gets misinterpretted by others (that's their problem, and perhaps also none of their business if they were not so interested in trying to ensure that others are behaving/operating "the right way" -- or in accordance with the program).
again, the way that I present the idea of trusting my emotions above everyone else's critisims and attempts to get me to build and/or adhere to a structure that pleases them, is again pretty subversive and problematic for the maintenance and endurance of the social/political/religious structures that are in place (and expected that all well-behaving citizens are supposed to adhere to). again, I know from personal experience that trying to adhere to those structures just simply doen't work at all for me, usually creating bigger problems. going at my speed, which is true for all attractive people (who don't temper their emotions, just letting them manifest, because there isn't sufficcient time to try and change them) will have increasing difficulty fitting into any structure at all. I believe *my way* is *the only way* (lol) to effectively navigate at those speeds, because manifestations happen so fast. with manifestations occurring that quickly, they're just impossible to be too proactive about by "setting up boundaries" or trying to create logic for how they should happen. I can only proactively setup my responces to whatever happens like "not my problem" or "nothing I can do about that" (instead of feeling guilt/embarrassment/shame for not adhering to the program). those methods all sound like "cop outs", and probably from an external perspective of someone looking in from the outside would believe that I'm just telling people to shift the blame to others by pointing out that they attracted my (unwanted) behaviour -- whereas from my perspective, I really would have loved to know when I was a kid that being low resistance, means that my body feels like the people that I'm interacting with and *the way my environment feels isn't the way that I feel* -- and that *my body isn't my emotions*.
inotherwords,-- though I think that it would be a whole lot of fun to teach someone else what I know, I really dislike the amount of disruption that it'll have on society as a result. as I mentioned in the previous letter, my goal is to try my best to not need the rules to change, lowering my resistance and having as little effect on the installed structures as possible. I don't want to bring any more chaos and destruction than I'm already doing -- and if I were to actually teach someone what I would know,-- and let's say that a significant enough people actually took my advice,-- this creates a truly disastrous situation for those that want to maintain the structure. my goal has always been to create a low-impact way for others to gradually learn what I know, not be destructive by being subversive. as it stands, I think I prefer not to directly influence anyone else to do what I do. perhaps as soon as things start to really fall apart, there will be more desire to know what I know. I prefer for (as attraction speeds increase) people to begin asking me about what I think is an effective way of navigating (ie, me responding to their desire) rather than telling everyone "the secret".

### 2024-12-10 18:37 - photons and science

yesterday night (actually it was this morning) at the end of our conversation you sent me a video about gravitational waves, which sent me into a rant about science. I said, "why can't they just call a photon an electron" -- or something like that. I also said that I prefer to do my own science research by just looking at and trying to figure out the concepts for myself, rather than relying/waiting on science to give me the answer. your comment was that was my ego talking -- and while I do have a good sized ego, my frustration with science and that sort of thing stems from my desire to figure out the fractal nature of how the (physical) universe is built (I don't much care about the subatomic stuff, cause it's not necessary). I *know* (and there's an overwhelming amount of evidence to support the idea) that the universe is fractal in nature, and different structures and arrangements repeat theirselves (with slight differences) over different size scales. not only do I want to know more about how our solar system works, I also want to compare and contrast that to things on the atomic scale.
presently (and I'll be pleasantly surprised to find out I'm wrong) I don't know of any science source that actuallly talks about the mechanics of the atom and the electron in any detailed way. so, for example I believe that the solar system is a pretty good starting point for figuring out the atom. the sun is like the proton in the middle -- which presently science says that different atoms have more than one proton in them, which works out numerically, (and I'm not saying that there aren't abnormal atoms that have binary/trinary nuclear systems to them (like sirius has essentiall two protons at its centre)) but I think it probably better fits the solar system model that we see around that the quanitiy of protons that are found in the nucleus is actually the *size* of the nucleus, just like all around the galaxy we find some stars that are larger and some that are smaller -- but they tend to have only a single star or a binary companion (though it's also my belief that atoms with a binary proton systems do exist and  are a "special" type of atom which usually doesn't occur -- but they can and do in certain situations). I think electrons are pretty similar to planets/comets, as they're solid bodies that travel with inertia. there's pretty good evidence that this is the case too, because the basic electron orbitals are on the orbiting plane of the proton (ie, around its equator) -- with some orbiting as if they're moons to the proton (ie, like mercury/venus), then wih others on a farther out orbit (like jupiter/saturn/uranus/neptune), and also as the neutron gets heavier and more complex, there are some orbitals that are steeply inclined like you'd see a comet. it just makes sense that those electrons/planets must obey similar rules.. so, for example, whatever rule it is that causes a planet to go from the outer orbital (like neptune) and to start taking on a more inclined orbit will probably give some insight into why pluto's (or more extreme eris and gongong) orbit is so inclined.
the orbits of the planets in our solar system are extremely slow when compared to atoms (which means they're at a much higher frequency -- think of how bass is like 20-100 cycles per second, plants orbits are in cycles per year, which is an extremely long wavelength) so we can think of the orbits of electrons as happening considerably faster (probably trillions of times per second or something -- maybe faster). that type of vibration is around a centre (the proton), so the wave that it produces (ie, the way that it perturbs the medium arund it) is going to be one kind of wave. also, we see that planets rotate along an axis as well. additionally, there's another axis as well, which is the poles -- and the planet doesn't need to rotate along its polar axis. that's three different influences that will act on the outer medium as well. none of these are explained -- because an electron rotating an axial tilt will have a far different effect than one rotating directly on it's axis (is this sorta like how light is "polarised" with some amount of the photons/electrons rotating same as the axis and some rotating perpendivular to the axis? I don't fully know). 
furthermore, I know (though I can't find any scientific documentation on it) that as the sun/proton increases its output, the electron/planet will increase its rotational speed, becoming more and more energetic [that's actually one of my theories for why many parts of earth have been relocated to farther out planets/moons in the solar system -- and why there have been calendar changes around the roman times (they added two months) and also around the time of shakespere], and so if increasing the rotational speed of the planet has some effect, I would imagine that this dramatically increases its output/emission as it goes to a higher frequency.
I suspect that the spin rate of the electron/planet/photon determines its emission spectrum (ie, the faster it spins, the more it "blueshifts"), so for now I'll just take that to be the way that it is. when an electron gets going fast enough, we see that a photon is emitted (consider the condensation reactions presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSWshPEF8Dk) for some ideas). well, after the photon/electron is emitted, the electron "relaxes" into a lower orbital. that gives me a number of questions: namely -- did the electron go flying off and start traveling through the medium -- and if it does, then does the imbalance that is now felt in the solar/proton system cause the proton to emit a huge "solar flare" which then coalesces into another planet/electron which settles into in the lower energy orbital. or, if no electron ever leaves the proton/solar system, what causes the electron to go down into a lower orbital? let's say that the proton/star's solar flare is the origin of the photon -- well, then that means that the light received somewhere else is nothing other than the vibration of the medium and not the electron itself. that would create a whole lot more questions too, because it would mean that light can only be perceived as vibrations in the medium, and that outside of earth the light won't be seen in the same way because the medium is going to be at a different density (for example, in the solar medium, it's quite possible that the emitted vibrations from distant stars would be at likely a much higher frequency (propagating at a much faster speed than the speed of light)). that would mean that the spin of the planet/electron (or maybe it's the proton that's emitting) is causing these waves to propagate in the medium. I'd want to know about that -- and what exactly is this medium made up of? is it more proton-like things which exist at the subatomic scale, or what?
I have a lot of questions, and I'd really like science to present some insight into what's happening -- because spin determines everything. there are also these things that are called "cosmic rays" which are like really high energy electrons that are blasting through the medium at nearly the speed of light. I imagine that these are something like what we consider electricity to be -- electrons that are blasted off or attracted to some source. do those things emit in all directions? like for example, are cosmic rays coming off of the sun in all directions, being attracted to the heliosphere? I would suspect so, because then that means that the highest frequency and most attractive part of the sun is out in this sphere that surrounds the solar system. if there really is this really high frequency sphere of attractive protons(?) surrounding the solar system, then that would be like a really attractive reflector, where when the solar wind and other stuff makes it out there, it'll impact this spherical reflector at high speeds, blasting the particle to bits producing a bunch of high frequency smaller particles, and bouncing/reflecting all of the larger bits back in toward the star again (which probably circle in to the star at the poles, because I know (and is pretty obvious) that the most attractive part of the star (ie, it's high frequency attractive protons) are all in the very core of the star (ie, the "white dwarf" part -- with all of the emissive protons being the majority outer layers of the star)). do atoms have such a reflector around them as well?
next, let's just say that electricity is just an electron that has a pull on it that's sufficient for it to be pulled out of orbit from its proton/star, that electron will fly off in the direction of the source of its attraction (which could just be another proton that's missing electrons or some other thing) -- well, then there's still a lot more questions here, because that proton, having been in orbit to a proton will still have a lot of the same rotational velocity as it leaves, which means that it'll still be spinning, and it's position that it was in when it left the proton is going to give a very different quality to this electron flying toward whatever's attracting it. let's say the electron has no axial tilt to it, and it's spinning one direction (say CCW from top-down), how does that interact with protons that are spinning in the opposite direction? do they get repelled by the proton producing the perpendicular "magnetic" wave, or do they go crashing into the proton (I feel like some sort of statistics on the spin of sun-diving comets relative to the rotation of the sun and the comets trajectory might give some insight into this). there are other cases too -- like what if the electron has axial tilt -- and what if the axial tilt is so extreme that its polal and/or rotational axis is pointed at the sun/proton (like uranus), does the eletron go shooting off spinning like a bullet going through a rifled barrel with its pole pointed at the source of it's attraction -- and if it does, then what kind of wave does this create? is that what magnetism is? I just don't know.
it's worth noting that, now that I've asked all of these questions, I'm sure that the answers will make their way to me, so I won't be ignorant forever. however, I'm only making the point here that there's just so much to all of these vibrations, that a simple "wave function" isn't good enough for me. there are so many ways that something can vibrate (I mentioned at least 4 above), and also for there to be wave propagation of any kind, there needs to be a liquid/gas medium where things can bounce off one another, or a vibrational lattice involved somewhere. it's not *just* a photon.
