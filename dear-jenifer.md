### 2024-12-08 23:25 - evolution of desire

when we were talking tonight about stuff, I omitted a pretty significant detail (and potentially gave the wrong impression as well), mostly because I didn't really know how to summarise it in any consise or meaningful way. looking back on it just now I might have given the impression that I was a bit upset with these various young girls taking interest in me, and also that I didn't know what to do about it. neither of those impressions are true.
like I mentioned, late 2012 the raquel thing was totally done. I got beat up by a guy wanting 5eur that I had for another crack rock and had to move away from alcobendas (a suburb of madrid where I was living -- the house raquel and I got). having that whole world crash down to bits, I had to rethink things consierably. you see, all of my life, the stuff that I *believe* is possible, is. I have *always* been able to do the things that I think are possible, and to a large extent, the futures that I believed were going to happen, also did. I came to spain with full belief that tuenti was going to be a massive success, and that I was going to begin to reshape the world to be the one that I lived in, starting with that social network. however, it obviously didn't work out, and my opinion of it is that the network posed a pretty serious threat to various competitors, and their desire for such a network to not exist was pushed against in the "saturnian-system" (the visual/symbolic system whereby time can be manipulated to produce the reality that they desire) -- and so after trying so hard to push out my ideas out on to the world, I finally had to give up on that whole thing and just let it go. also, I should mention that when I met raquel, she was just a receptionist at a hotel, but I felt an extreme amount of affinity with her, which is why I was so drawn to talk to her. after she invited me to barcelona and we got together, again, I had full belief that I'd met essentially the woman of my dreams. I had realised that such a structured and analytical woman like patricia wasn't what I was really looking for -- and again, my optimism lead me to believe (and I had lots of "visions" and premonitions of it) that we were going to have this amazing relationship, and that she was going to be able to really help me bring my ideas out to reality.
	however, I think this too was thwarted becuase, I'm pretty sure that I would have figured out star-watching on the attic patio that we had, yet the landlord (also named raquel) decided to put in a big gazebo right before we moved in. there were also a number of other things that derailed our relationship as well, but they're too numerous to mention. either way, looking back on it, I'm pretty sure that relationship also fell apart cause of the influence of the saturnian-system too.
with her gone, my whole system of "creating reality" (through my belief) just simply isn't working. I couldn't seem to get any of the stuff to work out the way that I believed they were going to work out (though it did work previously)	-- so distraught by thinking that all is lost, I finally started learning about how "law of attraction" works. I recognised pretty quickly that visualisation and belief are really inferior techniques -- and that emotion and my perception of reality really is the precursor to every manifestation. unsure of what it is that I actually did want (and neither did I want to try to visualise/believe it (cause this is output)), I turned to attraction instead, which essentially states that my reality will reflect how I feel. so, I gave up all of my attempts to try and figure out what it is that I wanted beforehand (like I did with with patricia where I calculated prior to going to berlin that a girl exactly like her would be what I was looking for -- then getting to berlin, there she was -- but my calculations were off a bit, because it turned out perhaps I was wrong). so, instead of outputting what I want, I was just going to feel good about things, and avoid all of the drama chicks (cause they felt bad to me) and just *allow* the one that felt like me to show up. I essentially turned asexual, because as I encountered various girls passing through my life, sure many were physically attractive, but I didn't like how they *felt* (ie, they were usually obsessing over things and experiencing emotions (drama) that I didn't like how it felt). I stayed asexual for quite a while, essentially finding nobody that felt good to me.
as I worked with marcos on afinaty (the social network based on affinity), our disagreements provided me with a whole lot of opportunity to learn to feel good no matter the circumstances (I'd worked on another social network previously called essembly that also had idological proximity, and from my experience there, I felt like I had a much better grasp on what he should create, yet he didn't want to do things *my way*, and that made me angry). I finally gave up and just started to do things his way, deciding that I preferred to feel good, rather than be right or to have things go my way. I really started to get good at that, and I was really starting to feel really good pretty consistently, when his daughter (andrea) started to become a major factor. apparently me feeling pretty good and having the ability to feel good in siutations where I'm not getting my way makes me pretty attractive. I didn't really know what to think at first, but I have the opinion that the universe provides, and because she is/was so reflective and pretty young, she felt a lot like me -- which is the feeling that I like, because I actually like myself -- so I felt good about her. the problem obviously being her age -- and at 11, she was just about to start entering into puberty where her symbolic/logical mind starts to turn on, and the structure that she's been picking up all of her childhood (like how to behave and stuff) starts to conflict with her emotional mind. as an example, it was incomprehensible to her that she couldn't go after something that's so attractive to her (me) just because society says that there are age limits and stuff. so, instead of following what feels good to her, as her logical mind starts to engage, puberty starts because now she the rules say that she can't get/do the things that she wants -- so automatically (because all of her examples fight and complain and push against the rules), she starts fighting all of the rules just like all of her adult examples in her life do (puberty in a nutshell). at the same time as she's starting to fight the structure, I'm learning the opposite, which is to ignore/follow the rules, and instead of feeling bad about the restrictions put on me, to instead find ways to feel the way I want and *attract* good-feeling manifestations, instead of trying to will the way i want it to be. (essentially, I'm attractive to her because I have a capability that she'll want to have when the rule system starts to come crashing in on her good-feeling world with all of the "you can'ts").
I was a bit upset that she showed up and started to wreck things, because my ability to feel good meant that the website was starting to do well and gain traction. also I was learning to work with marcos and be able to perform the tasks that were necessary *inside of his rules*. so I actually was starting to see/believe the website was going to be a success. *finally*, I was going to start creating something I wanted to create (ideological proximity was also one of the things I wanted to add to tuenti) -- and she shows up and starts to cause problems.
after some thinking on it, I decided that if she is what the universe is giving me, and also if I can keep up this pattern of feeling good despite the constraints imposed on m5, I figured it would actually work out -- so I softened to the idea that this could actually be something really awesome the universe is providing me. I talked with marcos very openly about it, and encouraged him to let me start hanging out with her before her puberty started to really derail her mind. I figured that I could help her to see that she can feel the way that she wants to feel *despite the imposed structure*. so, I ended up being fully OK with it. I didn't have any shame about it, and I was fully open about the thing to everyone. I found it quite strange that a young girl would like me, but obviously it would probably have to be that way because the way that parenting is done, is to essentially tell kids that they can't do things, and that they have to behave in a certain way (usually so that the parent isn't caused to feel bad by their behaviour). all older girls will have gone through puberty, and (unless they've learned how to feel good on their own) will be requring conditions (most notably their relationship with me) to make them feel good. I figured it would be impossible to find a girl that's actually able to feel good in spite of the restrictions placed on them by their social and cultural structure -- so obviously, younger it will have to be.
	I should also mention that there are a whole lot of difficulties that remain: I basically have nothing in common with someone so young, and I can't really talk with them about anything that interests me either -- and neither could they actually help me out with stuff that I wanted to work on (back then I was programming most of my waking hours, not like now where I'm pretty idle). so basically we're most entirely incompatible. I had no idea how to solve that problem, other than just figuring it out as I go, and again just sorta finding a way to feel good no matter the situation. I had no idea how it would work out, and I was fairly certain that our extreme incompatibility would cause me to be a pretty terrible boyfriend(?) anyway -- cause mostly all of what I wanted to do was to create something where I was able to find other people who are ideologically and conceptually similar to me. (inotherwords, I wanted to create something that would allow me to find other people I could actually talk and hang around -- someone on my level -- and typically I've found those people to be (sometimes much) older than me). so I was wanting to create something that would obsolete her. also I wanted others to know what I had figured about about how easy it is to attract/manifest things based on how I *feel* about my reality. there was no guarantee that she would have any interest in any of that, so I actually figured it'd be a pretty short relationship too, with her going off to the other (macho/handsome/atheletic) guys that could perform in the ways that she wanted them to perform for her. as much as I wanted it to work, I was quite unsure about the viability of it. too many incompatibilities. on that note though, I'm really actually glad it failed.
after another set of difficulties (the mental institution and getting my right hemisphere turned off), I came to pueblo where the difficulties continued. as you'll eventually read in my really old writings, I didn't know how to get rid of this "nosebook"/"the network" problem, because they were manipulating my life and constantly confining me to have less and less. obviously I hadn't learned the thing that I was intending to teach to andrea so well, because I let my ideas of how nosebook *should* treat me cause me to increase intense amounts of anger (a whole lot of it was experienced watching stars where we were talking tonight), and -- it took me a few years, but I started to really get it. I've been continually pressed more and more to the extreme all the way through my homelessness -- and I'd say that it's only been recently (last few months) where I don't really have any more anger left in me -- and I'm no longer trying to push to get anything I want anymore.
	real quick before I get to the main topic, I'd like to point out that I've figured out that the evolution of desire is essentially *I need (some thing/concept)* -> *I want (some thing/concept)* -> *I'll create (some thing/concept)* -> *I AM (that thing/concept)*. notice how anger is in the *need* category (I *need* someone to be/do something different). the reason why it makes us angry is because it threatens our sense of survival -- because the stuff that we *need* are the things that feel essential to survival. if there's no way to get that thing, that's depression or completely feeling defeated -- but when we're angry, it's a *motivating* force that causes us to feel like it's not completely impossible to get the thing we think we need. wanting is a lot more neutral, but that creates expectatons/beliefs, which when it happens, makes us feel good (like I thought I was going to feel after making tuenti, getting together with raquel, etc), and then there's the idea that "OK, if I can't get it from outside of me, then I'll create it myself". I experienced this multiple times in figuring that I could solve my problem of not being able to find anyone that's even remotely ideologically similar to myself could be solved by *creating* something that would produce the output that I desire. then, finally -- there's the idea that even to create the thing, all creations are an extension of the consciousness of the creator, so therefore, the creator has to have/be/embody the concept that they want to create. inotherwords, if I want something to feel good, I can *need* something to make me feel good, I can *want* something to make me feel good, I can *create* something to make me feel good, or I can *become* someone that feels good.
as I've passed my time in pueblo, I've come to realise that it's just not possible to find that thing outside of myself that I originally wanted. in the months leading up to my homelessness, I outlined a whole bunch of different things that I wanted to create,-- everything from new genetics (with 3X, 6X, or 10X pairs of cromosomes) to an idea where I'd launch a new artifcial moon of earth which would revolve around the equator and do a whole bunch of cool stuff. however,-- like I mentiond above, the reality of me creating these things is pretty slim to none. there's a whole saturnian-system designed to ensure that I must live within the rules that they have for me (ie, they don't want me making any websites or anything like that, and they also ensure that no underage relations ever occur -- or any sex at all, for that matter -- because they run their entire system on my right hemisphere, and sex would totally destroy their system). I don't have the resources to fight the saturnian-system, and at this point neither do I want to. I fully/radically accept their rules, and have any intention of trying to break them. I've passed the point where I can get any manifestation anymore because if that were to happen, it would break all of their rules. all visual/symbolic/astral systems involves rules and a hierarchy that I want nothing of. my destination is 3d, where there are no rules other than attraction. whenever they're ready (ie, when they can't hold back my attraction any further), they'll be forced to let go of me, and something entirely unexpected (something I cannot imagine) will manifest (I have no idea what it'll be). it's worth waiting for, and at this point, it's really not all that hard for me to feel the way I want to feel. I don't need anyone or anything to be different than how they are for me to feel good. therefore, my *only* job is to just feel the way that I want to feel, regardless of the rules. that's it. there's nothing more to it. they'll keep adding more and more rules to ensure to manifestation occurs, and I've come to figure out, *that's what I want* -- because eventually I'll be in the universe where there are no rules; only attraction.
	inotherwords, a manifestation is symbolic and quantifyable, which means it has rules -- so anything of that sort puts me in the universe of rules -- which I don't want. I *refuse* to go to that universe. I don't want rules. I like that things are constantly evolving and changing/improving as a reflection of my perception of it. anyone who tries to get me to go to the world of rules, is essentially trying to break the rules (lol) -- and they'll be stopped, I assure you.
so in closing: all is fine. there will be no underage girls at all, ever. no rules will be broken, and I have no interest in the worlds of higher dimensions. **all things are possible in 3d**
